FULL TEXT OF THE BOOK (1955 edition)

      Introduction
     
      1. Our Motherland,
     
      the USSR, is a socialist country. Our Motherland is the largest country in the world. In the north, there is eternal ice, and in the south, the summer is so hot that oranges and lemons ripen, and tea and cotton grow.
      Our country ranks first in the world in natural resources. Everything necessary for life is available in our country.
      Up to 60 different nationalities, approximately 200 million people, live in the 16 Soviet republics. All of them united in one fraternal union—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or, for short, the USSR. All the peoples of the USSR live as one friendly family and work for the common good. In the USSR, there are no capitalists and landowners, as in other countries. In the USSR, there is no exploitation of man by man. We all work for ourselves, for the whole of society.
      From a backward country, our Motherland has become the most advanced and powerful.
      That is why we love our Motherland so much and are so proud of our USSR—the country of socialism.
      The great Communist-Bolshevik Party showed us the path to socialism. It led the struggle of our fathers and mothers, the struggle of the workers and peasants, when they overthrew the rule of the tsar, landowners, and capitalists. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we created workers' and peasants' power; we built socialism.
      The peoples of our country successfully repelled all attempts to attack the USSR. The Soviet Union defeated German fascism and the Japanese invaders. Our country became even more powerful.
      What will this book teach you? It will tell you how people lived in the old days, how the peoples of the USSR fought against their oppressors and enemies, and how they achieved that our homeland became a country of socialism. From this book, you will also learn about the lives and struggles of peoples in other countries.
      All this is called history.
      We love our homeland and we must know its remarkable history well. Those who know history will better understand present-day life, will be better able to fight the enemies of our country and strengthen socialism.
     
      I. Our Homeland in the Distant Past
     
      2. How People Lived in the Distant Past
     
      How do we learn about the lives of people in distant times? One day, children were digging a hole on the bank of a river. They found strange bones and a stone in the ground. They took the find to the teacher at school.
      “You guys,” said the teacher, “have found very interesting things. These are the bones of ancient large animals. Once upon a time, a long time ago, these animals inhabited our area. Now they are extinct. And the stone is a tool used by people who lived in ancient times to kill wild animals.”
      The teacher tied the stone to a stick, and the result was a heavy hammer.
     
      “These are the kind of hammers primitive people had,” said the teacher.
     
      The teacher told the children that scientists were excavating throughout the USSR and, from their finds, were learning how people lived in the most distant times.
     
      The life of primitive people. About half a million years ago, almost our entire country was covered in a thick layer of ice.
      Centuries passed, and gradually the ice melted. It melted from the south. It was in the south that the first people appeared.
      Their life was very hard. Wild animals roamed all around—enormous mammoths and bears. People hid from them in caves and dugouts. People ate roots, berries, the meat of killed animals, and dressed in the skins of the animals they managed to kill. People hunted together, and they managed to kill even such a powerful beast as a mammoth. Together, people consumed their prey.
      More centuries passed. People learned to make their own fire, make tools from stone, wood, and bone. They invented the bow and arrow. Gradually, people learned to tame wild animals and began to breed livestock. After another millennia, people learned to sow useful plants and began farming. For shelter, people built huts, small huts, and wagons from cattle hides, and made clothing from flax.
      For a long time, people made do with stone and bone tools. Many thousands of years passed before people learned to mine ore and smelt copper and other metals.
      In those ancient times, people shared everything—tools and the food they obtained. Everyone was equal in their hard working life.
     
      3. From Clan to State:
     
      Clans and Tribes. It was impossible to hunt large animals, catch fish with nets, or cut down forests for arable land alone. Therefore, in the old days, relatives did not disperse, but lived together in clans, sometimes several hundred people. They had everything in common. They used tools communally. They went hunting and fishing together, and cultivated the land with joint efforts. The catch and harvest were divided among themselves. Livestock was shared. Elected elders supervised the work. Common affairs were decided at meetings of the entire clan. The clan protected its own. If a stranger killed a person, relatives would avenge the murdered one. Frequent wars broke out between different clans over fields, pastures, forests, and fishing grounds.
      Several neighboring clans formed a tribe. A tribe could consist of several thousand people. All members of a tribe spoke the same language and adhered to the same customs. The tribe had an elected leader.
      For many centuries, people lived in clans and tribes. Gradually, clans began to divide into families. The larger and more powerful families began to take over plots of land, some livestock, and run their own farms, stopping sharing what they obtained with others. They took captives and forced them to work for them. Thus, inequality arose within the tribe. Instead of communal ownership of the products and tools obtained, private property emerged. Some clan members acquired more property, others less. There emerged the rich and the poor.
      The rich and military leaders of warlike and powerful tribes raided their neighbors, took people captive and turned them into involuntary slaves.
      Tribal leaders and wealthy men received more slaves than other warriors.
      Those who accumulated large numbers of slaves became even richer. Wealthy leaders gathered bands of warriors around themselves, fed, housed, and supplied them with weapons. With these bands, the leaders launched new raids. They kept the plunder and captives from these raids for themselves and their warriors.
      The leaders and wealthy men forced not only slaves but also their own tribesmen to work for them and took a portion of their spoils.
      Thus, oppressors—the rich and the oppressed—the poor—emerged within the tribe.
      A state emerged. A small group of wealthy men began to live at the expense of the vast majority of workers, oppressing and robbing them. The leaders, with the help of their retinues, forced slaves and tribesmen to obey them. They became absolute masters of their tribes. Such tribal leaders were called princes, kings, and khans. To keep people in line, princes, khans, and kings expanded their retinues, established their own courts, and instituted various punishments.
      Not content with dominating their own tribes, they also subjugated neighboring, weaker tribes. This is how states were formed.
     
      4. The oldest states in our country:
     
      The first states in Transcaucasia and Central Asia. The most ancient states in our country arose in the south of Transcaucasia. This was about 3,000 years ago. The first state in Transcaucasia was called Urartu. It was located in the Ararat region near Lake Baiskoye. Georgia and Armenia later emerged on the territory of this state. The kings of Urartu had many slaves who built palaces for them and dug canals to irrigate the royal fields and gardens.
      The kings of Urartu waged constant wars with neighboring states. These wars were very brutal. This is evident from the inscription that one of the kings of Urartu had his slaves carve on a rock:
      "I put sixty-four thousand people to death, some I carried off alive."
      Similar states existed in Central Asia. These were the states of the ancestors of today's Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkmens. Their rulers also constantly warred with their neighbors.
      The ancient states of Transcaucasia and Central Asia had many cities. To protect against enemies, high stone walls were erected around the cities. Skilled craftsmen and slaves built houses for the wealthy, warehouses for goods, and for trade. Many artisans lived in the cities, and trade was brisk.
      City dwellers invented the alphabet and learned to read and write. For example, the alphabet was invented in Georgia more than 2,000 years ago. The first scientists appeared in the cities, and science and art began to develop.
      Peoples who inhabited Siberia and Eastern Europe in ancient times. Numerous tribes of nomadic pastoralists have long lived in southern Siberia and the Black Sea region. Led by their kings, they moved across the steppes with herds of cattle and horses in search of good pastures. About 2,500 years ago, the Scythian nomads were particularly powerful among these tribes. Under the rule of the Scythian kings, there were many nomadic and sedentary farming tribes and slaves.
      Over 2,500 years ago, settlers from Greece arrived on the northern shores of the Black Sea by ship. The Greeks built several cities here and conducted extensive trade with the Scythians. They bought cattle, grain, and fish from the Scythians and sent them to Greece for sea. Gradually, the Greek cities expanded and united into a single state.
      Wealthy Greek rulers and merchants did not work themselves. All the work was done by slaves, mostly Scythian captives. 2,000 years ago, Scythian slaves, led by the slave Savmak, rebelled against their oppressors and seized power. But the slave rebellion was suppressed by foreign troops arriving from overseas.
     
      A slave in shackles.
     
      In the 4th century AD, the powerful nomadic Huns attacked and routed Greek cities. In the 5th century, the formidable Hunnic ruler Attila launched a campaign from the Black Sea steppes against the peoples of Western Europe, conquering many of them. But after Attila's death, his kingdom disintegrated under the onslaught of other nomads coming from Asia. In the 6th century, the nomadic Khazar state emerged on the Volga in place of the Hunnic possessions, and further up the Volga, the state of the Bulgarians.
      The neighboring Slavic tribes warred with the Khazars and Bulgars for many years.
     
      5. The Slavs.
     
      The Slavs and their neighbors. Fifteen centuries ago, Slavic tribes occupied lands along the shores of the Baltic Sea, along the Dnieper and Danube, and in the upper reaches of the Oka and Volga rivers. Subsequently, the Slavs living in Eastern Europe formed three large peoples: Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians.
      To the east, their neighbors were the Volga tribes—the ancestors of the modern Mari, Mordvins, and other peoples—and further afield, the Bulgarian and Khazar states. To the south, the Slavs fought with the nomads of the Black Sea steppes. They also fought with the Greek state of Byzantium, a wealthy and cultured empire for its time. Greek artisans built remarkable buildings, palaces, and churches. The Greeks had writers, musicians, and painters. They produced beautiful silk fabrics, tableware, and gold and silver items.
      Byzantium had many well-armed soldiers. But the brave and courageous Slavs often defeated Greek troops. In the mid-ninth century, they waged a successful war against the Greeks and even attacked the Byzantine capital, Constantinople.
      In the west, the Slavs had to fight Germanic tribes and the Varangians.
      Slavic occupations. The ancient Slavs hunted and collected honey from wild bees. Later, agriculture became their main occupation. The Slavs would burn a patch of forest and sow grain into the ash-fertilized soil. This method yielded a good harvest, but after 3-4 years, the soil would become depleted, requiring a new patch of forest to be burned. In the steppe, the soil was loosened with hoes and then grain was sown, but even with this method, the soil would cease to yield after 4-5 years. Old plots had to be abandoned and new ones developed. This type of arable work, using very crude tools, was carried out communally—by the clan. When the iron-tipped plow appeared, horses began to be harnessed to the plow. Cattle manure was used as fertilizer. Fertilized and better cultivated arable land now yielded more food. A small plot of arable land could feed a family. The need for large communities to cultivate arable land began to disappear. Individual families were assigned plots of land, considering them their own. Clan and tribal leaders seized large tracts of land and forced their slaves to cultivate them. Free but impoverished people of various clans worked on these plots. Owners of plows and horses would rent out their plows or horses for a share of the harvest, thereby growing rich. The former equality disappeared; oppressors and oppressed, rich landowners and poor plowmen, emerged among the kin. By the 9th century, the Slavs already had boyars—landowners and wealthy men—as well as princes—tribal rulers. Princes and boyars traded grain, honey, and wax with the Greeks and other neighbors, but their greatest trade was in slaves captured by princely or boyar retinues. Trade took place in fortified points along trade routes, mostly along the banks of large rivers. By the 9th century, several Slavic principalities had emerged. The center of each was a city where the prince and his retinue resided. By this time, the Slavs had several cities. The most important of these were Kiev and Novgorod.
     
      II. The Kievan State
     
      6. Formation of the Kievan Principality
     
      Varangian raids. In the 9th century, bands of Varangians, inhabitants of Scandinavia, raided the Slavic lands around Novgorod and along the Dnieper. Varangian princes and their retinues stole furs, honey, and wax from the Slavs and took people captive. They loaded the captured loot and captives onto boats and sailed along the rivers and lakes connecting the Baltic with the Black Sea, traveling to trade with the Greeks in Byzantium. This route was called "the route from the Varangians to the Greeks." It ran from the Gulf of Finland along the Neva River, Lake Ladoga, and the Volkhov River to Lake Ilmen. From there, the boats traveled up the Lovat River and were then dragged overland to the Dnieper. Rapids, or large rocks, blocking the Dnieper, impeded passage. Here, boats and luggage had to be unloaded and dragged along the shore. The warlike Pechenegs, who roamed the surrounding area, took advantage of this and often attacked passing merchants. From the Dnieper, Varangian boats entered the Black Sea and, keeping close to the shore, sailed to Byzantium.
      The Slavs, along with neighboring tribes, often rebelled against the Varangian robbers and drove them back across the sea. Individual Varangian retinues managed to return to Slavic lands and subjugate local Slavic princes, imposing tribute on the population.
      The beginning of the Kievan Principality. At the end of the 9th century, as recounted in ancient records, there was a Varangian prince in Novgorod named Rurik. The Slavs he conquered paid him tribute. After Rurik's death, the warlike Oleg became prince. He did not remain in Novgorod, but descended the Dnieper, reached Kiev, captured it, and made it his capital.
      From the beginning of the 10th century, the Kievan Slavic principality was called Kievan Rus'.
      Oleg united many Slavic tribes under his rule and imposed heavy tribute on them. Some Slavic princes were exterminated, while others submitted to Oleg and, together with him, collected tribute from the Slavic population.
      The Varangian princes and warriors did not possess a higher culture than the Slavs; they soon interbred with the Slavs and adopted their language, faith, names, and customs.
     
      Prince Oleg.
     
      Prince Oleg demonstrated vigorous activity. Under him, Kiev was heavily fortified. Guard fortresses were erected on the state's borders to protect against nomadic peoples. According to legend, Oleg, with a huge army, some in boats and some on horseback, set out on a campaign against Byzantium. He ravaged the environs of Constantinople and laid siege to it. The Greek Emperor (as the chief ruler of the Greeks was called) offered Oleg a large ransom: much gold, fine fabrics, wine, and slaves. In 911, the Greeks concluded a trade treaty with Oleg.
      Oleg greatly strengthened Kievan Rus'. He gathered the disparate Slavic tribes and principalities under his rule. Kievan Rus' began to be reckoned with by both the Byzantine Empire and neighboring western states.
      Prince Igor. After Oleg's death, Rurik's son, Igor, ascended to the throne. Under his rule, the expansion of Kievan Rus' continued. Igor fought extensively, like Oleg.
      He led campaigns against the Caucasus and Byzantium. The Greeks paid Igor a large and valuable ransom. By agreement with the Greeks, he pledged to defend Byzantium from nomadic raids.
     
      Polyudye. The prince and his retinue collect tribute from the population. The population brought animal skins, wax, and honey. The prince's servant counted and noted the amount of tribute brought on a tablet.
     
      Every autumn, Igor collected tribute from the population—he went "from one person to another," and therefore the collection of tribute was called "polyudye." By the time the prince and his retinue arrived, the villagers had prepared furs, honey, wax, and grain. Polyudye was a heavy duty for the population.
      Once, Prince Igor was collecting tribute from a Slavic tribe, the Drevlians, who lived on the right bank of the Dnieper. The Drevlians gave him everything he demanded. Igor left, but he felt the collection was insufficient.
      He returned and demanded tribute a second time. The Drevlians said, "If a wolf gets into the habit of wandering among the flock, he will slaughter the entire flock. Let's kill him." They routed the prince's retinue and tied him by the feet to the bent treetops. When the trees were released, the prince was torn to pieces.
     
      7. Princess Olga and Prince Svyatoslav
     
      . Princess Olga. After Igor's death, his wife Olga became prince. She took cruel revenge on the Drevlians for her husband's death. Olga's retinue laid siege to the Drevlians' main city. For a whole year, she stood with her army at the city walls and was unable to take it. Then, according to legend, she resorted to cunning. She demanded a very light tribute from the Drevlians—three pigeons and three sparrows from each household. The Drevlians agreed to this tribute. By Olga's command, tarred bundles of tow were tied to the pigeons' and sparrows' feet, lit, and the birds were released. The pigeons and sparrows each flew to their nests, and immediately a fire broke out throughout the city. Olga's troops rushed to the burning city and killed many of its defenders. Olga imposed a heavy tribute on the Drevlians. But then she established precise tribute amounts for all tribes, thereby streamlining its collection. Olga traveled to Byzantium to learn from the Greeks how to govern a state, and there she became acquainted with the Greek faith.
      The Slavs at that time still practiced paganism. They did not understand natural phenomena and feared them. Storms destroyed their homes. Lightning set houses and trees ablaze. The sun scorched crops. People considered the sun, wind, and thunderstorms to be gods. They made images of them from wood and stone and sacrificed animals, and sometimes children and captives, to them. This was their way of appeasing the fearsome gods they had invented.
      Olga was delighted with how the Greek priests preached everywhere that the king's power was sacred. Olga saw that the Greek faith was an excellent means of strengthening the prince's power and uniting the disparate Slavic tribes into a single state.
      Therefore, she herself converted to the Greek faith—Christianity—and persuaded her son Svyatoslav to do the same. But Svyatoslav refused. He believed that only arms could unite the Slavs and create a strong state.
      Prince Svyatoslav. Svyatoslav became Prince of Kiev after Olga. He spent his entire life on campaigns. During campaigns, he slept on the ground, by the fire, in the open air, with a mat under him and a saddle under his head. Svyatoslav ate whatever he could find—horse meat, animal meat baked over coals. Fearless, he warned the enemy of his attack and sent a message: "I am coming against you."

      Svyatoslav conquered many tribes on the Oka River, plundered the Bulgarian cities on the Volga, the Circassians on the Kuban, and destroyed the Khazar kingdom. From that time on, the Khazar kingdom ceased to exist. The Kievan principality grew stronger and more powerful. The entire Black Sea region came under the rule of the Kievan prince.
      Then Svyatoslav began a war with the Bulgarians living on the Danube. He captured many cities from them and planned to move his capital from Kiev to the Danube. The cunning Byzantine emperor, fearing such a powerful and warlike neighbor as Svyatoslav, enlisted the Pecheneg nomads, then living in the steppes near the Black Sea, to attack Kiev. While Svyatoslav was driving the Pechenegs away from Kiev, the Bulgarians on the Danube conspired with the Greeks to fight Svyatoslav together. In a new war with the Bulgarians and Greeks, Svyatoslav was defeated. On his return to Kiev, he was ambushed by the Pechenegs at the Dnieper Rapids and routed. Svyatoslav himself fell in battle. The Pecheneg prince made a cup from his skull and drank from it at feasts.
     
      8. The Kievan princes introduce a new faith and laws.
     
      The campaigns of Prince Vladimir. Svyatoslav's son, Vladimir, having taken control of the Kievan principality after a protracted struggle with his brothers, followed his father's example and launched a campaign against his rebellious subjects. He pacified the rebellious tribes in the north and plundered the Bulgarian cities on the Volga. Then Vladimir marched with his retinue into Poland and captured several cities. Vladimir subjugated the Slavic Principality of Polotsk and the lands of several Lithuanian tribes—the Slavs' neighbors to the west, near the Baltic Sea. Thus, the Kievan principality grew stronger and more powerful under Vladimir. Byzantium began to reckon with him even more. Vladimir helped Byzantium suppress a rebellion by the Greek army. For this assistance, the Byzantine emperor gave him his sister in marriage. Vladimir decided to convert to Christianity. He believed that accepting the Greek faith and being related to the Byzantine emperor would strengthen his power.
      The introduction of Christianity. In 988, Vladimir destroyed all the images of ancient Slavic pagan gods in Kiev. The Kievans were driven into the waters of the Dnieper. Greek priests brought from Constantinople read their prayers over the people standing in the water. This was called baptism.
      The people rebelled against the new faith more than once, but all rebellions were suppressed by the prince's retinue.
      Christianity, in its time, represented a significant step forward in Russia's development compared to paganism. Along with Christianity, Greek culture and education spread among the Slavs. Byzantine artisans taught the Slavs how to build and decorate houses and churches. Learned Greek monks created a Slavic alphabet, which came to be used in the Kievan state. The prince gave Greek priests and monks money and allocated them land. The monks wrote church books in Slavic, translating them from Greek. They also recorded all important events. These records were kept "from summer to summer" (year after year) and were called chronicles. Chronicles provide much information about the history of the Eastern Slavs and neighboring countries. Folk songs and tales—bylinas—also tell us about this time. The bylinas contain many tales of the prowess of Slavic heroes and their struggle against nomads attacking the Kievan state.
      Prince Yaroslav the Wise. After Vladimir's death, Yaroslav, nicknamed the Wise, became the Kievan prince.
      Under Yaroslav, the first set of laws of the Kievan state, the "Russkaya Prazda," was compiled. The "Russkaya Pravda" set out rules for protecting the rights of slave owners, landowners, and merchants.
     
      9. Spontaneous popular uprisings in the Kievan principality
     
      . How princes and boyars ruled the Kievan principality. The Kievan prince had a large retinue—an army of boyars and service people. The prince's relatives and boyars governed cities and lands on behalf of the prince. Some boyars owned large amounts of land and rivaled the princes in wealth.
      The prince, his army, boyars, priests, and monks—all lived off the labor of slaves and farmers, the smerds. The smerds owned small plots of land, ran their own small farms, and were free, meaning they were not enslaved. Under the first Kyivan princes, they paid them only tribute, which the princes went to the polyudye to collect.
      Kyiv and other cities were home to artisans, traders, and the urban poor. Merchants traded with the smerds and artisans, delivering goods to the princes, boyars, and their army. The merchants kept the artisans in bondage. Large merchants traded with other countries.
      Free artisans built houses, churches, and bridges, sewed clothing, made dishes, and weapons. They smelted ore in bloomeries and mined iron. Blacksmiths worked in towns and villages.
      City residents were governed by a general assembly of citizens—the veche. The veche elected city leaders from among the wealthy and noble. Without the veche's consent, the prince could not raise an army or wage war. Therefore, he had to obey the veche in many ways. The princes tried to seize control of the cities and abused the peasants in the villages.
      Princes and boyars enslaved the smerds. In the 11th century, princes and boyars greatly intensified the oppression of the people. They established their own laws, administered justice, and meted out punishment. For example, under Yaroslav the Wise, the murder of a boyar was punishable by 80 hryvnia (or 16 kilograms of silver), while the murder of a smerd was punishable by only 5 hryvnia.
      Princes and boyars seized land and declared it their own. The smerds living on the seized lands were forced to work the princes' and boyars' fields, build bridges, and fortifications. Little by little, free farmers were reduced to dependent peasants, that is, serfs. The smerds responded to these practices with new uprisings against the princes and boyars.
      Spontaneous uprisings against princes and boyars also occurred in the cities. Many uprisings occurred in Kiev, Novgorod, and other cities in the 11th and 12th centuries. Princes and boyars with their retinues suppressed these uprisings without much effort, as they were spontaneous and unintentional. In 1113, the oppressed urban populace of Kiev rebelled against the princely authority, the merchant moneylenders, and the wealthy Kiev-Pechersk Monastery. They were supported by the smerds (commoners). Then, the frightened boyars and merchants hastened to summon Vladimir Monomakh, Prince of Pereyaslav, as their prince. Vladimir suppressed this rebellion. Fearing further uprisings, he somewhat eased the payment of debts to moneylenders and made minor improvements to the situation of some farmers.
      Vladimir Monomakh was well known in Byzantium and Europe. For his time, he was an educated man. His mother was the daughter of a Byzantine emperor, and his sister was married to a German emperor. He himself was married to the daughter of an English king. Vladimir Monomakh was the last powerful prince of Kiev.
     
      10. Novgorod Land.
     
      Fragmentation of the Kievan Principality. In the 12th century, the Kievan Principality was divided among the sons, grandsons, and relatives of Vladimir Monomakh. Constant wars broke out between them for control of principalities and cities. In these wars, the princes mercilessly plundered the commoners and townspeople, forcing them to participate in their campaigns. The princes dealt cruelly with each other. They gouged out the eyes of the defeated and starved them in prison. Individual princes grew wealthy and became independent of the Grand Prince in Kiev. Thus, in the 12th century, the Galicia-Volyn Principality to the west of Kiev, and the Rostov-Suzdal and Novgorod Principalities to the north, grew wealthy and powerful. The Kievan land was devastated by raids from the south by a nomadic people, the Polovtsians. An ancient work of art, The Tale of Igor's Campaign, has come down to us about the struggle against them at the end of the 12th century.
      The Kievan land was further devastated by the rapacious plunder of princes and boyars. The peasants, unable to tolerate their violence, left the Dnieper for farther afield—to the Oka and Volga. Kiev's trade also began to decline. Merchants began traveling from Europe to Asia by other routes, bypassing Kiev. Kiev began to lose its importance as a major city. By the early 13th century, Kiev had become desolate. Novgorod emerged as the leading center of foreign trade. Novgorod,
      the ruler of the Novgorod land, stood on the route to the Baltic Sea, along whose shores lay German and Swedish cities. Novgorod merchants and boyars conducted extensive trade with their German and Swedish neighbors. They received materiel, weapons, and other goods from them, and in return sold them furs and agricultural produce. To obtain furs for foreign trade, Novgorod boyars and merchants conquered lands in the north and east and forced local trappers to hand over their spoils. Novgorod thus became the capital of a very large country, with several thousand houses. While Kiev was declining, Novgorod boyars and merchants grew rich from plundering conquered peoples and trading with foreigners.
     
      Foreign merchants unloaded their goods at the Novgorod wharf.
     
      All affairs of the Novgorod land were governed by boyars, wealthy merchants, and the high clergy. They summoned Novgorod residents to a general assembly—a veche—but matters were decided according to the wishes of the rich and powerful boyars. The governor of Novgorod, the posadnik, elected at the veche, was always a prominent boyar. The prince in Novgorod had limited powers.
      Novgorod residents, the smerds of neighboring villages, and conquered tribes repeatedly rebelled against the rule of the boyars and merchants.
      But these uprisings never progressed beyond spontaneous rebellion. The people were unable to break the boyar and merchant power due to their lack of awareness and organization.
     
      A veche (assembly) in Novgorod. At the assembly, urban artisans confront the boyars and wealthy merchants with their demands.
     
      The struggle between Novgorodians and the Swedes and Germans. In the early 13th century, the Swedes attacked Novgorod. They advanced from the Baltic Sea and the Neva River, where Leningrad now stands. The Novgorodians defeated the Swedes at the Neva. Prince Alexander, who defeated the Swedes and commanded the Novgorodians, was nicknamed Nevsky for this victory.
      In 1242, German knights also attempted to seize Novgorod. They appeared on the shores of the Baltic Sea in the 12th century and mercilessly plundered and exterminated the Slavic, Lithuanian, and other tribes living there. The Germans built their fortresses and cities here and further intensified their atrocities. They imposed their faith on the inhabitants, destroyed their freedom, and turned them into serfs.
      German "knight-dogs" with a strong army attacked the Novgorod land, ravaging cities and threatening Novgorod. The great Russian commander, Prince Alexander Nevsky, gathered his troops and engaged the Germans in a decisive battle on the ice of Lake Peipus. The battle was fierce—the ice turned red with blood. In this Battle on the Ice, the Germans could not withstand the onslaught of the brave Novgorod warriors and fled. Alexander Nevsky pursued the enemy to the very border of his lands. Thus, the Novgorodians decisively repelled the enemy and defended their land from the German tyrants.
     
      11. Suzdal Rus'
     
      Rostov-Suzdal land. Since ancient times, the Mordvins, Mörya, Ves, and other tribes lived between the Volga and Oka rivers. Slavs also lived here. By the 10th century, the Slavic cities of Rostov and Suzdal were already in this region.
      Slavic farmers fled the oppression of princes and boyars from the southern regions of the Kievan Principality, ravaged by nomads. But even here, the princes and boyars seized land and forced the population to work for them.
     
      The Princely Court.
     
      At first, the Rostov-Suzdal land attracted little attention from the princes of the Kievan state. But this changed in the 12th century, when this remote outskirts became populated. Prince Yuri Dolgoruky, son of Vladimir Monomakh, came here from Kiev with a strong retinue and consolidated his power, subjugating the holdings of individual boyars and minor princes. Among the holdings he captured was the village of Moscow.
      But Andrei Bogolyubsky, son of Yuri Dolgoruky, established an even stronger foothold in Rostov-Suzdal Rus'. He waged war against Novgorod, the Bulgars on the Volga, and the Mordvin tribes. He then captured Kiev and became Grand Prince of the vast holdings of almost the entire Kievan state.
      Andrei Bogolyubsky made the city of Vladimir on the Klyazma River his capital. From that time on, his principality became known as Vladimir-Suzdal. Andrei Bogolyubsky sought to subjugate all the local princes and boyars.
      Dissatisfied with Andrei Bogolyubsky's autocracy, the boyars conspired and assassinated the prince. Vsevolod became prince in Andrei Bogolyubsky's place. He took villages and lands from the rebellious boyars and severely punished those who attempted to declare themselves independent princes.
      Vsevolod launched several campaigns against Novgorod and extended his authority to Kiev. He fought against the Bulgarians and Mordvins on the Volga. Vsevolod was unable to establish a strong hold on the other minor princes and boyars. After his death, the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality fragmented into small holdings. Each prince and boyar tried to live independently and did not submit to the Grand Duke. The fragmented small principalities feuded with one another.
      There was no unified, strong state. Each wealthy owner sought to acquire more land and power. Princes constantly warred among themselves. Constant campaigns devastated the peasant population. When the Mongol conquerors attacked the Russian principalities in the 13th century, they encountered no truly united resistance. The Vladimir-Suzdal land was fragmented into small parts and could not defend its independence.
     
      III. Eastern Europe under the Rule of the Mongol Conquerors
     
      12. Mongol Conquerors and the Tatar-Mongol Yoke
     
      . The Mongols in the 12th Century. The Mongols were nomadic pastoralists. They lived in what is now the Mongolian People's Republic.
      In the 12th century, the Mongols were divided into large warlike tribes led by khans. The khans had abundant livestock and pastures. The subject tribes paid tribute to the khans. The khans fought among themselves and their neighbors over tribute and pastures.
      In the early 13th century, the talented military leader Genghis Khan rose to prominence among the Mongol khans. He assembled a vast army from various tribes and subjugated the eastern Turkic-Mongol peoples.
      Like a hurricane, Genghis Khan's cavalry swept through his enemies. Genghis Khan burned the wooden walls of fortresses with clay grenades laced with petroleum. He smashed stone walls with massive engines. Nothing could stop his onslaught.
      Genghis Khan's conquest of Central Asia and the Caucasus. Having conquered Northern China, Genghis Khan moved his troops into Central Asia and conquered it.
      From Central Asia, rounding the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, Genghis Khan's troops advanced to the Caucasus and conquered Armenia and Georgia. In Georgia, the Mongols encountered strong resistance. At this time, Georgia was a more powerful state than Armenia. The Georgians fought bravely, but the Mongols defeated them and imposed heavy tribute on Georgia and Armenia. For hundreds of years, Central Asia and the peoples of Transcaucasia remained under Mongol rule.

      Batu Khan and his conquest of the Russian principalities. Having subjugated all the peoples of the Caucasus, the Mongol army defeated the combined forces of the Slavic princes and the Polovtsians at the Kalka River in 1223. Carrying rich booty, the Mongols retreated to Asia.
      Thirteen years later, the Mongols reappeared on the Volga. At their head stood Batu Khan, the grandson of the deceased Genghis Khan. This time, the Mongols attacked the Russians from the east. Batu Khan defeated the Volga Bulgars and the Mordvins, then slaughtered the armies of the Russian princes one by one. In 1240, he captured Kyiv and marched on Western Europe. Repulsed by the Czechs, Batu Khan turned back and founded his own state on the lower Volga River—the Golden Horde—with its capital at Sarai. It was a wealthy city with stone palaces, gardens, and a mint. The Khan of the Golden Horde became the ruler of the lands he had conquered. The princes remained in their positions, but were subordinate to the Khan.
      The Tatar-Mongols collected tribute from the population in favor of the khan. To collect the tribute, the khan's deputies were posted in the cities with military detachments. No one was spared in collecting the tribute.
     
      "...whoever has no money, he will take his child;
      whoever has no child, he will take his wife;
      whoever has no wife, he will take his head"
     
      (that is, he will take her prisoner and sell her into slavery). So went the folk song.
      Since rebellions constantly arose against the Tatar tax collectors, the khans of the Golden Horde later handed over the collection of tribute to the Russian princes themselves.
      Thus began the Tatar, or, more accurately, Tatar-Mongol yoke.
     
      Khan Batu.
     
      13. Moscow and the first Moscow princes
     
      Moscow. On the hill where the Kremlin now stands, there was a settlement called Moscow at the beginning of the 12th century. Moscow is first mentioned in chronicles in 1147. In 1156, it was surrounded by a wooden wall.
      The Tatar-Mongols of Khan Batu burned Moscow and the wooden walls of its fortifications. Some residents perished, others fled into the surrounding forests. But gradually, the population regrouped near Moscow and took up farming.
      By the 14th century, Moscow had become the capital of a small principality. Moscow's central location in the Russian lands helped the Moscow princes unite other principalities around it. Moscow was surrounded by forests, making it easier to fight enemies, especially the Tatars. Moscow's location on convenient river routes allowed the princes to collect large duties on all goods transported along the Moscow River.
      Ivan Kalita. Moscow gained particular strength under Prince Ivan (1328–1341), who was nicknamed "Kalita," meaning moneybag. With gifts and flattery, Kalita won over his overlord, the Khan of the Golden Horde, and received the right to collect tribute for the Khan from all Russian lands. Kalita kept part of this tribute for himself and his principality. With the money he accumulated, he purchased villages, volosts, and even entire principalities. Ivan Kalita slandered the Tatars against neighboring princes and set the Tatar Khan against them. Acting on his denunciations, the Tatars killed the princes and ravaged their principalities. Kalita annexed these devastated principalities to his Moscow Principality. The Khan made Kalita senior over the other Russian princes, declaring him "Grand Prince." At the beginning of his reign, Kalita owned only four towns; upon his death, he left his children 97 villages and towns.
     
      Moscow in the 12th century.
     
      Thus, Kalita united the disparate Russian principalities into a single state centered around Moscow.
      Kalita's descendants were similarly "gatherers." By the end of the 14th century, the Moscow Principality had become so powerful that Kalita's grandson, the outstanding military leader Prince Dmitry, decided to openly oppose the Tatar yoke. In 1380, at Kulikovo Field on the Don River, he defeated the Tatar forces led by Khan Mamai. The victory at Kulikovo Field was of tremendous historical significance: it united the Russian people in the struggle for their national independence, inspired them with self-confidence, and undermined the foundations of the Tatar yoke. However, two years later, the Tatars gathered their forces, attacked Moscow, and captured it, forcing it to pay tribute, albeit less than before.
      The young Moscow Principality nevertheless grew stronger. Its old enemy, the Golden Horde, was weakening. But a new, powerful adversary emerged on the western borders of the Moscow Principality: the Lithuanian state, united with Poland.
      The Lithuanian state and its relationship to Moscow. The Lithuanian tribes were neighbors of the Slavs and lived to the west, near the Baltic Sea. By the 13th century, the Lithuanian tribes united under a single prince and, in the 13th and 14th centuries, took over Belarusian lands and parts of Ukrainian and Russian lands. Lithuania became a large state. At the end of the 14th century, it came very close to the Grand Duchy of Moscow and captured the city of Smolensk. The Lithuanian prince Jogaila, having married the Polish queen, became king of Poland and Lithuania. The union of Lithuania with Poland greatly strengthened both states. They now began to exert even greater pressure on the Grand Duchy of Moscow.
      Life was hard for Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians under the rule of their princes and boyars. But their lives became even harder under the rule of Polish and Lithuanian invaders, who reduced all peasants to serfdom.
      The Polish lords forced peasants to convert from Greek Orthodoxy to Catholicism, their own faith. The Polish lords were particularly insistent on this conversion in Ukraine. In the cities, the lords did not allow Ukrainians and Belarusians to engage in trade or crafts. The lords controlled all city governance. The lords dreamed of subjugating the entire Muscovite Principality. But they were attacked by German knights entrenched on the shores of the Baltic Sea. The Germans plundered Lithuanian and Polish cities and ravaged the lands. They lacked the strength to fight the Germans and Moscow at the same time. Lithuania then made peace with the Muscovite Principality. The combined forces of Polish, Lithuanian, and Russian troops routed the Germans at the village of Grunwald (1410). Russian troops, especially the Smolensk regiments, distinguished themselves in this battle. However, soon after, Lithuania and Poland again intensified their attacks on the Muscovite state. To defeat Moscow, the lords formed an alliance with the Tatars.
     
      14. Tamerlane and the Decline of the Golden Horde
     
      Tamerlane. While the young Moscow Principality, uniting under a single prince, grew and strengthened, the Mongol state itself increasingly fragmented. Only occasionally did individual conquering khans emerge among the Mongols. One such conqueror was Tamerlane.
      Tamerlane was born in Central Asia in 1336. As he grew older, he became the leader of a band of daring men and moved from one ruler to another. Tamerlane first came to prominence during the suppression of a popular uprising in the city of Samarkand (Central Asia). Having dealt brutally with the rebels, Tamerlane soon declared himself Khan-ruler and made Samarkand his capital.
      Tamerlane conquered a number of neighboring states. In 1395, he defeated Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde, thereby helping Moscow to quickly free itself from the Tatar yoke.
      Tamerlane was ferocious and cruel. After capturing one city, he buried 4,000 people alive. When capturing another, he ordered his soldiers to bring him 70,000 heads of inhabitants and use them to build a tower.
      No matter what countries Tamerlane conquered, he brought the best craftsmen from everywhere to Central Asia. He brought up to 150,000 such artisans to his capital, Samarkand, whose embellishment he took great care to embellish.
      Uzbeks in Central Asia. After Tamerlane's death in 1405, the states he had conquered gradually regained their independence.
      In the 15th century, Central Asia was conquered by the nomadic Uzbeks, who had previously lived in the lands of modern-day Kazakhstan. The Uzbeks firmly established themselves in Central Asia. Uzbek khans became the heads of the states of Khorezm and Bukhara.
     
      IV. The Creation of the Russian National State
     
      15. Expansion of the Muscovite State under Ivan III and the End of the Tatar-Mongol Yoke
     
      . The annexation of Novgorod and the liberation of the Muscovite State from the rule of the Tatar Khan. To combat the Tatars and Lithuanian-Polish lords, the Muscovite princes sought to expand their holdings and strengthen their power over all Russian lands. Ivan III achieved this. He became Grand Prince in 1462. At this time, the Muscovite Principality was still under the rule, albeit weakened, of the Khan of the Golden Horde. Ivan deceived the Khan, assuring him of his loyalty, but quietly sought to accumulate strength and escape Tatar subordination. Ivan III united the principalities neighboring Moscow—Tver, Ryazan, and others—under his rule. All these principalities opposed unification under a single prince and formed alliances with the Tatars and Lithuania against Moscow. But Ivan III ensured that the Muscovite state became a strong and unified Russian national state under his rule. Only Novgorod remained independent.
      At the end of the 15th century, Ivan III waged war against Novgorod. The Novgorod boyars had formed an alliance with Lithuania. But this did not save them. Ivan III defeated the Novgorod forces, and Novgorod also became part of the unified Russian state. By this time, the Golden Horde had disintegrated into three khanates: Kazan, Astrakhan, and Crimea. The Siberian Kingdom on the Irtysh River seceded from it. The Moscow princes benefited from this disintegration of the Golden Horde. Now the Golden Horde was no threat to the strengthened Russian state.
      Choosing an opportune moment, Ivan III declared to the Khan of the Golden Horde that he would not recognize his authority over Moscow. The Khan then waged war against Ivan III. The opposing armies met on the Ugra River, but neither dared engage in decisive battle. Thus, they stood facing each other for several months. Frosts set in. The khan had no fodder for his cavalry, and he also received news of unrest in the Horde, so he turned back. Ivan III thus emerged as the "victor." Thus, in 1480, the Tatar-Mongol yoke, which had lasted over two hundred years, ended.
      Soon, the Horde finally withered and disintegrated.
      Ivan III's war with Lithuania and Poland. In 1500, war began between Ivan III and the Polish-Lithuanian king. The Polish-Lithuanian forces were utterly defeated, and their main leader was captured by Russian troops. The king then formed an alliance with the Baltic Germans—the knights. The Germans were initially successful, but then Russian troops went on the offensive, routed the Germans, and ravaged their lands.
      The war ended with a six-year truce. Ivan III retained the Russian and Belarusian lands he had conquered from the lords.
      Under Ivan III, the Russian state's holdings tripled.
      Ivan III became "Sovereign of All Russia." After the capture of Byzantium by the Turks in 1453, Ivan III married the Greek princess Sophia Palaiologina.
      Ivan III now claimed to be the heir of the Byzantine emperors. Ivan III adopted the ancient coat of arms of Byzantium (the double-headed eagle) as the coat of arms of the Muscovite state. Ivan began to call himself "Sovereign of All Russia."
     
      Coat of arms of the Muscovite state under Ivan III.
     
      Ivan began to intensively embellish Moscow. He imported Italian artisans, technicians, and artists from abroad. Ivan III rebuilt the small Moscow Kremlin into a large stone castle with buildings previously unseen in Moscow. The Kremlin walls and towers, built by the Italians, still vividly recall the time of Ivan III.
      Ivan introduced the opulent court customs of the Greek emperors to the Kremlin Palace.
      But the strengthening of the power of the Moscow prince led to the strengthening of the oppression of the boyars over the broad masses of the peasantry.
     
      16. How were peasants oppressed in the Muscovite state in the 15th century
     
      Corvée and quitrent. Throughout the Moscow Principality, princes, boyars, and monasteries owned estates. The landowners lived with their families, servants, and guards in estates separate from the peasants, surrounded by a high wall. Villages spread out in all directions from the master's manor. The peasants lived in low, smoky huts without floors, windows, or chimneys. The peasants plowed the land with wooden plows.
      The plots of land that the peasants cultivated and fed themselves from were now no longer peasant property, but princely, boyar, or monastery property. In exchange for this land, the peasants were obliged to do whatever the owner demanded of them. They plowed the master's land, threshed and milled the master's grain, mowed and hauled hay to the master's manor, built the master's manor, mansions, and bridges, and dug ponds and ditches.
      But all this was not enough for the princes, boyars, and monasteries. They believed that the peasants were still working too much for themselves and too little for their masters. The landowners began to take some of the land the peasants were cultivating for themselves. They demanded that the peasants work even more on the master's fields. All this work was called corvée.
      In addition to corvée, the peasants also gave their masters the products of their farms: grain, cattle, chickens, eggs, milk, butter, and so on. This was called quitrent. Those peasants who did not fulfill their corvée or quitrent were severely punished by their masters: they were beaten with sticks until they were half dead, or imprisoned.
      The peasants were bound to the land. A peasant could leave his master, but he had to leave behind his farmstead and buildings and pay all his debts, of which there were many. The peasant had to find another master who would let him onto his land. The new master had the same terms of use as the old one. The peasant had no way to escape his bondage, except to flee to lands where there were no masters. But such free lands became fewer and fewer.
      Landowners found it unprofitable for peasants to leave them whenever they wanted. Boyars and monasteries began allowing peasants to transfer to new owners only after all summer work had been completed. In 1497, Ivan III issued a law stipulating that a peasant could transfer from one lord to another only in late autumn, on St. George's Day.
      This strengthened the peasants' bondage to the lord's land. The lord had the right to judge his peasants and beat them for disobedience.
      In addition to boyar and monastic holdings, under Ivan III, the holdings of noble landowners—military servicemen, princely and boyar servants—began to appear. For participating in campaigns and guarding the borders, they received payment from the prince in lands and the peasants living on them. From these lands, cultivated by the peasants and subject to the landowner's authority, the landowner was required to feed himself and his family, acquire military equipment and horses, and lead a certain number of warriors on campaign.
      The prince placed service people on the lands he had seized. Such lands were called estates, and their owners were called pomeshchiks. Boyars, on the other hand, owned lands by inheritance—from father to son—and their holdings were called votchinas, or "otchinas."
     
      V. Expansion of the Russian State
     
      17. Ivan IV and the Defeat of the Volga Tatars
     
      . The Tsar-Autocrat. Ivan III's grandson, the future Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible, lost his father early in life; the boyars poisoned his mother and seized power for ten years.
      In 1547, seventeen-year-old Ivan became the first of the Moscow sovereigns to declare himself autocratic tsar and began to govern the state independently, distrusting the boyars and relying on the noble landowners.
      To consolidate his power, Ivan IV considered it essential that the people of his state be educated by reading books glorifying the Tsar's authority. Ivan IV used book printing, a Western invention, for this purpose and established a printing house in Moscow. Books were printed there under his special supervision. The first Russian printer at this printing house was Ivan Fedorov.

      The conquest of Kazan and Astrakhan. Consolidating his power and authority, Ivan IV continued the policy of conquest of his grandfather, Ivan III, and his father, Vasily III, who had captured Smolensk from Lithuania. Ivan IV decided to first capture the Tatar khanates on the Volga. In the autumn of 1552, Ivan IV, with a large army and numerous cannons, laid siege to Kazan, the capital of the Kazan Khanate.
      The siege lasted all autumn. The Tatars fought with desperate courage and tenacity. On the tsar's orders, a secret underground passage from Kazan to the water was blown up, forcing the city's inhabitants to drink tainted water from puddles and wells. The people of Kazan continued to defend their city. Without rest, day and night, they fought off the besiegers.
      The Tsar ordered tunnels dug under the walls and blew them up with barrels of gunpowder. Fierce fighting raged at the city gates and in the breaches. Ivan IV's troops—up to 150,000 strong—defeated the Tatars. Kazan was annexed to the Muscovite state.
      Many Muscovite service people and merchants were resettled in Kazan, while the Tatars were permitted to live only in the suburbs. Captured lands were distributed among landowners. Fortresses were built throughout the Kazan Khanate, housing Muscovite troops. All residents of the Kazan Khanate—Tatars, Mordvins, Mari, Chuvash, and Bashkirs—were forced to build fortresses. With the conquest of Kazan, they all came under the rule of Ivan IV.
     
      St. Basil's Church, built in Moscow by Ivan IV after the capture of Kazan.
     
      In 1556, Ivan IV's troops captured the city of Astrakhan on the Volga, the capital of the Nogai Tatars. The entire Volga route fell into the hands of the Russian Tsar.
      After this, Ivan IV captured the northeastern Caucasus and built several fortresses on the Terek River. Circassian and Kabardian princes began to enter his service.
      The Russian state began to transform from a national one into a multinational one, consisting of different peoples.
     
      18. Reprisals against the boyars and Ivan IV's warriors
     
      . Oprichnina. Having seized Tatar lands on the Volga and fortified himself in the North Caucasus, Ivan IV began a war with the Baltic Germans, Poland, Lithuania, and the Swedes. Ivan IV wanted to reach the shores of the Baltic Sea and establish relations with Western European peoples. The Swedes and Germans prevented foreign craftsmen from entering Moscow and did everything they could to hinder Russian trade.
      After the initial defeats in the war, Ivan uncovered the treason of the leading boyars who owned estates. These traitors went over to the service of the Poles and Lithuanians. Tsar Ivan waged a brutal war against the boyars, who opposed the unification of the country and the strengthening of the Tsar's autocratic power. He executed many boyars and their supporters, exiling others to remote parts of the state. He confiscated their lands, distributing them to small landowners (nobles). Ivan IV needed to combat the boyars to finally break these petty tsars, which the boyars were, and to strengthen his unified power. To combat them, Ivan IV formed a special detachment of several thousand landowners, calling them "oprichniks."
      The oprichniks had their own distinctive uniform. A dog's head and a broom were tied to an oprichnik's saddle. These were the insignia of his office: to sniff out and track down the Tsar's enemies and sweep away traitorous boyars.
      Ivan IV and his oprichniks exterminated many boyars. Ivan distributed the lands of the executed to the oprichniks and other landowners. In this way, Ivan the Terrible strengthened autocratic power in the Russian Tsardom by destroying the boyars' property.
      In this way, he effectively completed Kalita's unification of the disparate appanage principalities into a single strong state.

      Peasants and Cossacks. Under Ivan IV, the peasants' situation worsened considerably. Toward the end of his reign, peasants were forbidden to leave their masters, even on St. George's Day. It was then that the saying arose: "So much for St. George's Day, grandma!"
      Fleeing the plunder and violence of landowners and oprichniki, peasants fled from the center of the Russian Tsardom to the steppes, on its southern outskirts, and settled there. Many fugitive peasants settled along the Don and Dnieper rivers. Soon, settlements grew there, the inhabitants of which were called Cossacks.
      War for the Baltic lands. Ivan the Terrible fought for 24 years to gain access to the Baltic Sea. At the beginning of the war, Russian troops routed the German knights and captured several cities. But the war ended in failure for the Russian state. Poland, Sweden, and Denmark intervened. The Poles and Lithuanians recaptured the Baltics and took from Ivan the Terrible the Belarusian lands he had conquered at the beginning of the war.
      The Swedes took the shores of the Gulf of Finland from him. A convenient sea route for trade with foreign countries was once again lost.
      Ivan the Terrible was forced to conduct trade with foreign countries only via the inconvenient White Sea, which froze for several months each year. This route was accidentally discovered by an English captain. He wanted to cross the Arctic Ocean to India, but a storm drove him to the mouth of the Northern Dvina River, where the port city of Arkhangelsk was later founded.
     
      Yermak.
     
      Annexation of the Siberian Kingdom. At the end of the 16th century, the lands of Western Siberia were annexed by the Tsardom of Muscovy. The Siberian Kingdom was inhabited by Tatars and other Siberian peoples, and was ruled by Khan Kuchum. In 1581, the Stroganov merchants, wealthy owners of lands in the Urals, sent a small detachment of mercenary Cossacks, well-armed with firearms, against Kuchum. This detachment of Cossacks, under the command of Yermak, routed Khan Kuchum's numerous troops, armed with bows and arrows.
      Ivan the Terrible rewarded Yermak with military armor and a fur coat from his own shoulders, and his Cossacks with rich gifts. Kuchum, however, later managed to defeat Yermak's detachment. Yermak himself died in the Irtysh River during a night attack by Kuchum's warriors. Kuchum regained his power in the Siberian Kingdom, but not for long. Voivodes and troops sent from Moscow finally conquered the Siberian Kingdom a few years later.
      Under Ivan IV, Russia's dominions expanded many times over. His kingdom became one of the largest states in the world.
     
      VI. Peasant Wars and Uprisings of Oppressed Peoples in the 17th Century
     
      19. The First Peasant War in the Russian State
     
      Tsar Boris Godunov and the Beginning of Peasant Uprisings. In 1584, Ivan IV died. Shortly before his death, in a fit of rage, he killed his eldest son, Ivan, with a blow to the temple with his staff. He was left with two other sons—the feeble-minded Feodor and little Dmitry. The feeble-minded Feodor Ivanovich became tsar. Under Feodor, the tsar's wife's brother, Boris Godunov, a former oprichnik of Ivan the Terrible, ruled the kingdom. Little Dmitry, who lived with his mother in the city of Uglich, died or was killed by Godunov's supporters.
      In 1598, after Feodor's death, Boris Godunov became tsar.
      The peasants' situation worsened considerably under Godunov. They fled from the boyars and landlords to Ukraine and the Don. The country suffered three consecutive years of crop failure. A terrible famine ensued. The peasants ate chaff, cats, and dogs, even resorting to cannibalism. Various diseases broke out; corpses littered the roads; there was no one to bury them. In various places, peasants rose up and smashed their oppressors—the boyars and landlords. Popular unrest also began in the cities. This marked
      the first attempt by the Polish lords to enslave the Russian state. The Polish lords, longtime enemies of the Russian state, decided to take advantage of the opportune moment—the unrest in Russia—to enslave it. To this end, they spread a rumor that Ivan the Terrible's son, Dmitry, had not died in Uglich at all, but had fled from Boris Godunov to Poland. The Poles found a suitable person and, disguised as Tsarevich Dmitry, sent him with their troops to Moscow. This False Dmitry was to depose Boris Godunov and become Tsar in his stead. In Ukraine, Cossacks from the Don and Dnieper, dissatisfied with the boyars, joined False Dmitry.
      Tsar Boris Godunov died at this time, and the Tsar's troops offered no resistance to False Dmitry. False Dmitry reached Moscow unhindered and triumphantly entered it as the true Tsar. The mother of the deceased Tsarevich Dmitry was bribed by the boyars and publicly recognized the impostor as her son. False Dmitry became Tsar.
      The Poles rejoiced—their plan had succeeded: their protégé sat as Tsar in Moscow. False Dmitry married a Polish woman, Marina Mniszech, and gave her father much land. The Poles who came to Moscow with Marina occupied the best positions and began to rape and plunder the people. False Dmitry openly disregarded ancient Russian customs.
      Unrest broke out among the people against the Poles and the new tsar. The boyars, taking advantage of the unrest, plotted against False Dmitry and assassinated him. The impostor's body was burned at the stake, and the ashes were stuffed into a cannon and fired in the direction from which the impostor had come.
      A prominent landowner, the noble boyar Vasily Shuisky, became tsar. His election in Red Square in Moscow was orchestrated by the boyars and wealthy merchants during the popular uprising against the Poles.
      The peasant leader was Ivan Bolotnikov. Under Shuisky, peasant uprisings continued. At this time, they acquired an energetic leader, Ivan Bolotnikov. Bolotnikov had previously been a serf of a boyar and had fled from him. He had visited Turkey and Italy and seen much. Peasants, petty servicemen, and Cossacks flocked to Bolotnikov, a talented military leader. With his army, assembled in the south, Bolotnikov marched on Moscow in 1606 to overthrow the boyar tsar Vasily Shuisky and install another, "good" tsar.
     
      Peasants flocked to Bolotnikov's army.
     
      Along the way, in towns and villages, the rebels seized the tsar's officials, killed boyars and landowners, plundered their estates, and destroyed the homes of wealthy merchants. Bolotnikov's army was also joined by detachments of small landowners dissatisfied with the boyars' autocracy and the boyar Tsar Shuisky.
      Bolotnikov laid siege to Moscow. The landowners who had joined Bolotnikov soon realized that his victory would weaken the landowners' power. During the battle near Moscow, the landowner detachments deserted Bolotnikov and went over to the boyars and Tsar Shuisky. Bolotnikov's army was defeated.
      Preparing for a new offensive on Moscow, Bolotnikov retreated first to Kaluga and then to Tula. Shuisky, with a large army, besieged Bolotnikov in Tula. The rebel army bravely defended itself but was defeated. This is understandable. The peasants at that time had no ally or leader like the working class. And the peasants themselves were unconscientious. They fought not against tsarism and the landlord system, but against a bad tsar and bad landlords, for a "good" tsar and "good" landlords.
      In 1607, Ivan Bolotnikov was captured. The boyars gouged out his eyes and then drowned him in an ice hole. Things got even worse for the defeated peasantry: Shuisky issued new decrees increasing the bondage of the serfs. Now, for 15 whole years, a landowner could search for and recapture peasants who had fled from him. The uprisings continued.
     
      20. The Struggle with the Polish Invaders.
     
      The Polish invaders and their expulsion from Moscow. The Polish lords, after the failure of their first attempt to enslave Russia, made a second attempt. They put forward a new impostor. A rumor was spread that another man had been killed in Moscow by mistake, while False Dmitry had escaped. Ten thousand Polish troops accompanied the new False Dmitry. He and his army approached Moscow and set up camp in the village of Tushino near Moscow, demanding that Shuisky cede the throne to him. Shuisky called on the Swedes for aid. The Swedes, taking advantage of the weakness of the Moscow government, captured Novgorod. At the same time, the Polish King Sigismund approached Smolensk with his army, routed the Moscow troops, and laid siege to Smolensk. The enemy was tearing Russia apart.
      The Moscow nobles dethroned Shuisky and forced him to become a monk. At the same time, False Dmitry II was assassinated. Meanwhile, popular unrest continued. The Moscow boyars were unable to cope with the rebels. Then, instead of Shuisky, the Moscow boyars, trying to save their position, elected the Polish prince Vladislav, son of King Sigismund, as tsar. "Better to serve the prince than to be beaten by one's own serfs," said the boyars. In the autumn of 1610, the Polish army, with the help of the boyars, entered Moscow and occupied the Kremlin. The Polish lords seized much treasure from the treasury of the Moscow tsars. The invaders took estates for themselves, distributed lands to their supporters, and oppressed and plundered the Russian people.
      Six months later, in the spring of 1611, Muscovites rose up against their Polish oppressors. Barriers of tables, chests, and logs were erected on the streets of Moscow. From behind them, Muscovites fired upon the Poles. From the rooftops, they rained bullets and stones upon them. The Poles began to burn Moscow. Much of the city burned to the ground. The Poles fortified themselves behind the Kremlin walls.
      In the autumn of 1611, the Russian people rose up against the Polish invaders.
      The Nizhny Novgorod zemstvo elder, Kozma Minin, led the campaign against the Poles entrenched in Moscow. A large militia was equipped with funds he collected from the cities. Prince Pozharsky was chosen as the military commander. Some of the peasant units fighting the landowners joined the militia. And that was the deciding factor. The militia approached Moscow and besieged the Poles entrenched in the Kremlin. In 1612, the Kremlin was captured, and the Poles fled Moscow.
     
      Minin urged the people to fight the Poles.
     
      The Russian people produced many heroes in the fight against the Polish invaders. One such hero was the peasant Ivan Susanin. A Polish detachment forced him to serve as a guide. Susanin, sacrificing his life, led the detachment into the forest wilderness. Susanin was cut down by the Poles, but the Polish detachment could not escape the forest and perished.
      In 1613, representatives of landowners, merchants, and Cossacks convened in Moscow. They elected Mikhail, a Romanov boyar, as tsar.
      The Poles were forced to evacuate all the lands they had captured, but Smolensk remained in their hands. Only five years after the war did the Swedes return Novgorod to Russia, but the entire coast of the Gulf of Finland, with its Russian cities, remained Swedish.
      The peasant movement was crushed. The new tsar waged a brutal struggle against the still-raging popular movement. Many armed bands of fugitive peasants and Cossacks roamed around Moscow and throughout the country. The Tsar sent troops and military commanders to deal with the bands and participants in the uprisings. Prikazy (Tsarist chanceries) with their clerks and sub-clerks resumed their work in Moscow, and once again, as before, the people groaned at the military commanders and the military commanders.
      Tsar Mikhail generously distributed estates and large salaries to the landowners.
      Tsar Mikhail defended the interests of the landowners who elected him.
     
      21. Uprisings of city dwellers and oppressed peoples in the 17th century
     
      . Uprisings in the cities. After the death of Tsar Mikhail, his son Alexei became Tsar of Moscow. By his order, a heavy tax on salt was introduced in 1646. This tax increased popular unrest. Fearing an uprising, Tsar Alexei ordered the tax abolished. But this tax was not the only issue. Even after it was abolished, the people of Moscow nevertheless rose up against their oppressors. In 1648, the people of Moscow rose up in a "revolt," as popular uprisings were called at the time. The people remembered well the grievances of the tsar's servants and officials. The people demanded that the tsar hand over the chief of them for reprisal.
     
      Zemsky Sobor of 1640.
     
      The Tsar promised to fulfill the rebels' request. But the people began to be beaten with whips and trampled by horses. The crowd then sacked the houses of the particularly hated boyars and Tsarist servants, some of whom were killed. The Tsar's troops suppressed the uprising. In the same year, 1648, uprisings in other cities were also suppressed. Following these uprisings, the Tsar convened representatives of the boyars, landowners, and merchants in Moscow—the Zemsky Sobor. In 1649, they established the right for landowners to search for and return peasants who had fled from them throughout their lives. The peasants were completely enslaved. All villages and peasant households were registered. It became very difficult for peasants to hide. Craftsmen and small traders were also forbidden to move from one city to another without permission.
      In the cities, artisans lived in settlements named according to the occupations of their residents—tanners, potters, and gunsmiths. There were many such settlements in Moscow, the largest city in the state. In Moscow's settlements, small houses with two or three tiny windows stood in crooked, narrow alleys.
      Craftsmen earned little. Life was hard for them—they were robbed by governors and merchants.
     
      Craftsmen sold their wares in the marketplace.
     
      Uprisings by artisans and the urban poor continued. Such uprisings reached particularly large proportions in Pskov and Novgorod in 1650. Peasants also joined the uprising of the urban poor. Tsar Alexei was forced to send a large army to suppress this uprising.
      The urban poor continued to rise up in the following years. For example, a major uprising in Moscow occurred in 1662. During this uprising, the tsar's troops killed and drowned several thousand rebels in the Moskva River.
      The Bashkir Uprising. That same year, the people of Bashkiria, conquered by Tsar Ivan IV shortly after the capture of Kazan, rose up in the Urals. The Tatars joined the Bashkirs. The rebels seized a supply train with weapons and obtained gunpowder. They fought Muscovite troops for three years, besieging the tsar's fortresses, but were defeated.
     
      22. Ukraine's struggle for liberation from the oppression of the Polish lords, for reunification with Russia
     
      . War of the Ukrainian peasants with the Polish lords. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. From the 13th-14th centuries, Ukraine was under the yoke of the Polish-Lithuanian lords. They ultimately turned all peasants into serfs. For the slightest offense, the lords executed their serfs. Gallows were permanently erected near some Polish houses. The Poles forced the Ukrainian people to accept their faith.
      Peasants languished in lordly captivity both in Poland and in Belarus. The serfs fled from the lords to the Dnieper, where they built a small fortification beyond the rapids and called it the Zaporizhian Sich, and they called themselves Zaporizhian Cossacks.
      Another group of Cossacks lived in cities and towns. Cossacks were divided by wealth into rich and poor.
      The Cossacks united into regiments. Their chief commander was elected by the Cossacks and was called the hetman.
      Peasants and Cossacks often rebelled against the rule of the Polish lords.
      In 1648, the Ukrainian people rose up in a war of liberation against the lords' oppression. The outstanding statesman and Cossack commander Bohdan Khmelnytsky led the rebellious people. The peasants were the main force in this war.
      Men from Bohdan Khmelnytsky's army, disguised as beggars and monks, traveled through the villages of Ukraine, calling on the peasants to fight against the lords. The Ukrainian people were supported by Belarusian peasants, and sympathized with Polish peasants, who also suffered under the oppression of their landlords. The people of Russia provided constant aid and support to the Ukrainian people.
      The peasants plundered the lords' estates. Many victories were achieved over the lords' troops, but the war continued, bringing great devastation to the Ukrainian people. The Crimean Khan helped the lords devastate Ukraine.
      Ukrainians saw their salvation from foreign oppressors in unification with the great Russian people.
      The reunification of Ukraine with Russia. Expressing the Ukrainian people's desire for an alliance with the fraternal Russian people, Khmelnytsky appealed to the Russian government with a proposal to unify Ukraine with Russia.
      In January 1654, at a council (assembly) in the city of Pereyaslav, a decision was made to reunite the Ukrainian and Russian peoples in a single state.
      Russia could protect Ukraine not only from the Polish lords, but also from the Crimean Khan and Turkey.
      The Ukrainian peasantry was freed from the lords' bondage. No one imposed a foreign faith on the Ukrainians.
      Soon, Russia began a war with the Polish lords. After a long war, the lords were forced to renounce all Ukrainian lands on the left bank of the Dnieper and the city of Kiev on the right.
     
      23. Razin's War with the Boyars and Landowners.
     
      Cossacks on the Don. Runaway peasants in the south—on the Don and its tributaries—gathered large Don Cossack settlements, or stanitsas.
      In the mid-17th century, the Don Cossacks were unequal. Some Cossacks seized the best lands, established farms, traded, and became prosperous or home-loving. Others remained destitute, the rabble. The rabble were forced into indentured servitude to wealthy Cossacks or to survive by plunder. The tsar's military commanders captured the runaways and returned them to their landowners. The rabble harbored considerable hatred for the Muscovite landowners. The Cossack Stepan Timofeevich Razin led the rabble into rebellion.
      Razin and his struggle against the boyars and landowners. A foreigner who was in the Muscovite state at the time wrote of Razin: "His appearance was majestic, his bearing noble, his expression proud, his height tall, his face pockmarked. He possessed the ability to inspire fear and love."
      Stepan gathered a large rabble around him. He was elected ataman, that is, chief commander. Many Cossacks and others embittered against the tsar's military commanders and landowners joined Razin.
      In the spring of 1670, with 7,000 men, Razin attacked Tsaritsyn on the Volga (now Stalingrad) and captured it. Here, the tsar's army—the Streltsy—also defected to his side. Razin then marched on Astrakhan and took it after a two-day siege. The Cossacks slaughtered wealthy merchants, boyars, and the tsar's officials. Razin threw the Astrakhan military commander from a bell tower. In Astrakhan, the dvorianstvo appointed their own Cossack rulers.
      With military equipment captured in Astrakhan, Razin moved up the Volga. He captured cities and dealt with the tsar's military commanders and officials. Razin's messengers went to the peasants and recruited them to join the rebels.
      At Razin's call, peasants rebelled, killed their landlords, burned their estates, and marched in entire detachments to join Razin's army. The peoples of the Volga region—the Chuvash, Tatars, Mordvins, and Mari—joined the Russian peasants. Their different languages ​​didn't hinder them either. Hatred for the tsar and the landlords united them as one family.
      The peasant movement was crushed and Razin was executed. The tsar and the landlords assembled troops and regiments of hired foreign soldiers and marched them against Razin. Razin had a hard time defeating these well-armed forces. He gave them battle near Simbirsk. Razin was wounded, his army routed. Razin, with a small detachment, managed to escape to the Don. Wealthy Cossacks on the Don captured Razin and handed him over to the tsar. The tsar sentenced Razin to "a cruel death."
      In 1671, Stepan Razin was executed in Moscow.
     
      The execution of Stepan Timofeevich Razin.
     
      Tsar Alexei dealt cruelly with the rebellious peasants. Thousands of them were hacked to death, flogged, and hanged. The peasant insurrection was crushed.
      During Razin's rebellion, as during Bolotnikov's, the peasants lacked such a reliable ally as the organized working class. They also lacked an understanding of the objectives of the uprising: they knew how to burn and ruin landowners, but they did not understand what new order needed to be built or where to proceed.
      This was their weakness.
     
      24. Subjugation of the Peoples of Eastern Siberia
     
      . Conquest of Eastern Siberia. Cossack detachments penetrated Siberia by river, dragging boats from one river to another. Cossack Semyon Dezhnev, leading a small detachment, was the first to reach the strait between Asia and America by sea. The easternmost cape of Asia (Cape Dezhnev) is named after him.
      Following the Cossacks, Moscow's military commanders moved deeper into Siberia, settling in newly established towns and commanding Cossack detachments from there. Firearms, unknown to many of the Siberian peoples, helped the Cossacks defeat the locals. For a hundred years, the peoples of Eastern Siberia were subjugated to the rule of the Russian Tsar. By the end of the 17th century, almost all of Siberia was under this rule. The Khakass, Altai, Buryat-Mongols, Evenks, and Yakuts who lived there began to pay tribute—yasak—to the Russian Tsar.
      The peoples of Siberia were oppressed. Small wooden fortresses were built throughout Siberia. They housed military commanders and their troops. From these fortresses, the military commanders would travel to collect yasak from the local population.
      The military commanders forced the local population to plow the lands near the fortresses and fed their troops with the harvested grain. Russian peasants were also forcibly resettled in Siberia or lured with various benefits.
      Voivodes bribed local princes to facilitate their extortion of the indigenous population. Voivodes often sold local people into slavery in Central Asia. Voivodes sent Cossacks to conquer new peoples. The Cossack Khabarov and his retinue reached the Amur River in 1651. Along the way, he burned all villages that resisted him; the inhabitants fled into the forests.
      Russian merchants, priests, and monks accompanied the tsar's voivodes and troops. The merchants plied the Siberian peoples with vodka and confiscated the best furs from the drunks for next to nothing. Priests and monks seized land from the population, built churches and monasteries, and robbed the locals, forcing them to convert to Christianity and give them gifts.
     
      A Yakut fortress built by Russians in Siberia in the 17th century.
     
      The power of the tsarist government lay like a heavy yoke on the conquered peoples of Siberia. They repeatedly rebelled, killed their oppressors, and burned fortresses and cities. But the governors and merchants raised new military forces and dealt cruelly with the rebels.
     
      25. Economy and State Administration in Russia at the Late 17th Century
     
      . Landlord Economy. Having crushed the peasant uprisings, the landlords further increased their pressure on the serfs. They demanded that the peasants pay quitrent in cash. In addition, they increasingly took from the peasants grain, flour, butter, eggs, chickens, sheep, cloth, and linen. The landlords ate much of this wealth themselves, but they also sold much on the side. Hundreds of carts carried grain, flax, lard, and hides from the landlords' households to the city markets. Some goods were sold domestically, some were exported abroad. Landowners were keen to maximize their income from agriculture. Thus, they grew rich by robbing the peasants.
      Industry and Commerce. There were very few factories and plants in Russia at the end of the 17th century. They had only just appeared in Russia. Under Tsar Alexei, the cannon yard (zavod), where craftsmen cast cannons and church bells, was expanded. Ironworks and weapons factories operated in the cities of Kashira and Tula. The country had small mines and workshops, staffed by skilled craftsmen and serfs. Specialized craftsmen were brought in from abroad. At metallurgical plants, the hammer and bellows of small blast furnaces, where the ore was smelted, were powered by water. Water flowed through a trough and, like in a watermill, turned a wheel. Mechanisms were attached to the wheel that inflated the bellows and raised and lowered the hammer.
     
      A plant with water-powered bellows.
     
      All the factory buildings were wooden. Besides the cannon foundry, Moscow had only one stone factory—a manufactory where serf weavers handcrafted fabrics for the tsar's court.
      There were also potash factories in the Volga region and saltworks in the north and the Urals.
      Trade in Russia increased significantly with the reunification of Ukraine and the seizure of Siberia. Trade flowed throughout the country. Goods were transported long distances, by barges along rivers in summer and by sleigh in winter.
      Dozens of English and Dutch ships brought foreign goods from abroad and exported timber, furs, leather, potash, resin, grain, wax, honey, and caviar from Russia through Arkhangelsk. Every year, Russia exported goods worth more than 15 million gold rubles. The Dutch and English strove to control all Russian trade. To maintain its independence in trade, Russia needed its own fleet and more convenient seaports than Arkhangelsk, which froze for months. Such ports existed on the Black and Baltic Seas, but the Black Sea was then in the hands of the Crimean Tatars and Turks, while the shores of the Baltic Sea were under the control of the Swedes.
     
      Foreign soldiers in Russia with rifles and muskets in hand.
     
      State governance. In Russia, the Tsar, the autocratic ruler, ruled over all affairs. He lived in Moscow, in the Kremlin. The Tsar had advisors—boyars—whom he convened from time to time. The council of boyars under the Tsar was called the Boyar Duma. The Tsar decided all matters at his own discretion, but on important matters, he consulted with the boyars.
      The Tsar governed the state through his chanceries, which were called prikazes. The heads of the prikazes were boyars appointed by the Tsar. There were more than 50 prikazes. Clerks and sub-clerks sat in the prikazes. They wrote papers and accepted petitions. The state was divided into several large districts, governed by voivodes.
      In addition to the standing army—streltsy and military men—Tsar Alexei brought in mercenary troops of well-armed foreigners. But such troops were few in number.
      The Boyar Duma and the prikazy functioned very poorly. The entire state administration needed a radical overhaul.
     
      26. Culture in Russia in the 17th Century
     
      . Culture. The entire way of life in Russia at that time was backward, but the worst situation was with literacy. The population of this vast country was almost entirely illiterate. Even in the capital of the state, Moscow, there were very few schools and literate people.
      A few educated people emerged in Moscow from landowners who had traveled abroad. They lived like wealthy people in Western Europe, were fluent in foreign languages, and enjoyed reading scholarly books. Such people were few and far between. The boyars and tsarist officials looked askance at their connections with foreigners.
      Only the tsar and the boyars close to him were treated by foreign physicians. Russian physicians did not exist at that time. The people were treated by healers. They treated with prayers, whispers, water, fumigated the sick, and gave them various tinctures to drink, which often led to the death of the sick.
      There were no theaters back then. The first theater was built only for Tsar Alexei, where performances sometimes lasted the entire day. In the evening, the Tsar went to the bathhouse to wash away his "sin," since watching a performance was considered a sin.
      Priests taught people to obey the Tsar, the boyars, and the landowners. "All power comes from God," the priests said, "God endured and commanded us to do the same." Anyone who did not accept the church's teachings or read forbidden books was punished, sometimes even burned.
      Boyars and merchants wore large beards and long caftans. The women of the boyars, nobles, and wealthy merchants covered their faces with thick muslin. They were forbidden to meet or speak with other men. The common people disregarded these customs of their oppressors. Among the townspeople, artisans, and serfs, women enjoyed greater freedom.
      The Tsar and the landowners, with the help of the church, kept the people of Russia in darkness and ignorance.
      Russia was in need of serious reforms. Otherwise, it could have remained an uncultured and backward country and lost its independence. Peter I emerged as the reforming tsar who strengthened the Russian state of landowners and merchants.
     
      7. Russia in the 18th Century: An Empire of Landowners and Merchants.
     
      27. Peter I's Warriors and Popular Uprisings.
     
      The War with the Turks and Peter I's Journey Abroad. At the very end of the 17th century, Alexei's son, Peter I, became Tsar of Russia. Upon his accession, the intelligent and active young Tsar soon began to establish new orders. He completely disregarded the Boyar Duma and became very friendly with the foreigners living in Moscow. He recruited them into his service and raised new troops in a foreign style, dismissing the Streltsy, as an old-fashioned force.
      In 1695, Peter began a war with Turkey to open a route to the Black Sea. He built a fleet of 29 ships on the Don River and, with an army trained by foreigners, attacked and captured the Turkish fortress of Azov. During this war, Peter became even more convinced of the need to restructure the country's entire life and adopt European military and naval techniques.
      Peter went abroad. In Western Europe at that time, the leading countries were Holland and England. In Holland, he worked with an axe in his hands in the shipyards. In England, he mastered shipbuilding. Peter I spent about two years abroad and learned much. A rebellion of the Streltsy (musketeers) began in Russia; they were dissatisfied with the new order established by Peter and demanded a return to the old. It was a reactionary uprising. Peter returned from abroad and personally oversaw the crackdown on the rebellious Streltsy, who were dragging Russia backward. The Streltsy regiments were disbanded.
     
      Peter I (1672–1725).
      The War with the Swedes Begins. In 1700, Peter I began a war with the Swedes for control of the Baltic coast. The Swedes had the best army in the world and a good navy. Charles XII was King of Sweden at the time. Charles attacked Peter's troops besieging the Swedish fortress of Narva, routed them completely, and captured all their artillery and many prisoners.
      Peter, however, did not lose his nerve. He ordered the church bells removed and recast into cannons. 250 young men were sent to study literacy and the rudiments of mathematics to become artillerymen and craftsmen. A new army was recruited from among the serfs and trained in military affairs.
      Large sums of money were needed to maintain the army. Peter imposed taxes on bathhouses, mills, inns, even oak coffins, and doubled the price of salt. Peter introduced severe penalties for peasants fleeing their landowners. He ordered the destruction of all settlements of fugitive peasants in the upper Don region. Bashkirs were deprived of their cavalry horses.
      In 1703, Peter occupied the marshy mouth of the Neva River and built a fortress and the city of St. Petersburg (now Leningrad), which became the capital of the state under Peter. To build the fortress and city, Peter drove masses of serfs from all over Russia. Thousands died here from hunger and disease. The people responded to these torments with uprisings.
      Popular uprisings. Under Peter I, the Bashkirs, Tatars, and Udmurts rebelled. In 1707, a Cossack and peasant uprising broke out in the Don region. The rebels were led by the Cossack Kondraty Afanasyevich Bulavin. The rebels captured several cities. Peter sent an entire army against Bulavin. At this time, wealthy Cossacks plotted and attacked the farm where Bulavin lived. The ataman fought back until his last bullet. Unwilling to surrender to the enemy, Bulavin fired his last bullet into himself.
     
      These were Bulavin's final moments.
     
      The rebels fought Peter's troops for two years. Rebellious peasant villages on the Don were burned. Captured rebels were almost universally executed. Many thousands of fugitives were returned to their landowners.
      The reasons for Bulavin's defeat were the same as in previous peasant and Cossack uprisings.
      Having suppressed the popular uprisings, Peter concentrated all his forces on the fight against the Swedes.
     
      28. Peter I's Wars with Sweden and the Eastern Countries
     
      Defeat of the Swedes. The Swedish king, Charles XII, exploiting the treason of the Ukrainian hetman Mazepa, invaded Ukraine through Poland with his army. In 1709, the Swedes and Russians clashed near Poltava.
     
      Soldiers of Peter I's regular army
     
      . The Swedish troops were routed by the Russian regular army. Peter I himself distinguished himself in this battle. Charles XII and Mazepa fled to Turkey. Charles convinced the Turks to wage war on Russia. War with Turkey began again.
      Peter fielded a 40,000-strong army against the Turks. The Turks, however, assembled an army five times larger. Peter's troops were surrounded on the Prut River. He was forced to conclude an unfavorable peace with the Turks and return the fortress of Azov to them.
      After the defeat of the Turks, Peter decided to finish off the Swedes and finally secure the shores of the Baltic Sea for Russia. He took Riga and Reval from the Swedes and built a strong navy. The Swedish fleet was defeated in a naval battle.
      The war with the Swedes lasted for 21 years. Eventually, the Swedes signed a peace treaty, which ceded to Russia the lands along the shores of the Gulf of Riga and the Gulf of Finland.
      Peter I's struggle for the Caspian Sea coast. Peter I also decided to strengthen his position on the shores of the Caspian Sea, which served as a gateway to the East—to Central Asia, India, and Iran. He assembled an army of 80,000 men and led it from Astrakhan on a campaign against the Iranian lands. Peter had made advance arrangements with the Georgian princes, who were under Iranian rule, and with Armenian merchants, who were to assist him in the war against the Shah, the ruler of Iran.
      In addition to the land army, Peter also sent troops by ship. These troops landed in cities on the shores of the Caspian Sea and captured them. Peter captured the cities of Derbent and Baku.
      The Azerbaijani cities captured by Peter were then inhabited by peoples who had been conquered by the Iranian kings 200-300 years before Peter the Great's campaigns. The Azerbaijanis had continually fought the Iranian conquerors for their independence and against their oppression. Therefore, the native inhabitants of Azerbaijan did not offer serious resistance to Peter's troops.
     
      29. Reforms of Peter the Great
     
      Reforms in government. Peter the Great achieved his goal. The shores of the Baltic Sea were in Russian hands. Russia had come closer to Europe. Peter waged a relentless struggle against Russia's backwardness and reshaped its order along European lines.
      In place of the Boyar Duma, Peter established a senate composed of individuals appointed by himself. Instead of 50 departments, Peter created 12 collegia, which oversaw the army and navy, foreign affairs, the economy, and the courts. Nobility managed all affairs in the senate and collegia.
      Peter divided Russia into eight provinces. He appointed a governor at the head of each province, who governed the region and was responsible for recruiting soldiers and collecting money.
      To strengthen the power and authority of the nobility, Peter granted them full ownership of their estates. In 1721, after defeating the Swedes, Peter assumed the title of emperor. From that time on, Russia became known as the Russian Empire.
      Economic reforms. To increase state revenue, Peter introduced a poll tax, forcing all male peasants, young and old, to pay it. Under Peter, cloth and other manufactories were established. Serf workers worked on handlooms. Merchants were given money to establish new factories.
     
      The interior of a silk factory under Peter the Great.
     
      At this time, many free hired laborers were already working in England's factories. To provide merchants with workers, Peter assigned entire villages of peasants to factories. Under Peter, there were already more than 200 factories. Arms factories in Tula expanded significantly. New ironworks sprang up in the Urals.
      Merchants and factory owners quickly grew rich. Peter gave merchants their own management in the cities.
      Education. Peter placed great emphasis on education, even trying to instill it by force. Peter sent young noblemen abroad to study shipbuilding and foreign languages.
      Schools were opened where they taught maritime affairs, engineering, medicine, and other sciences. The teachers in the schools were English, Dutch, Swedes, Germans, and other foreigners whom Peter invited to serve in Russia.
      Peter ordered the opening of numerology schools in all provinces, where the children of the nobility were required to learn literacy—reading and writing, arithmetic, and geometry. Peter even forbade illiterate noblemen from marrying.
      Peter established the first Russian newspaper, Vedomosti, based on the European model and simplified the Russian alphabet for it.
      Before Peter, the New Year was counted from September 1st. Peter ordered the year to be counted, as was done abroad, from January 1st. The new calendar was introduced on January 1st, 1700, according to the new chronology, which is still used today.
      Peter ordered the nobility to cut their beards, wear wigs, and wear short waistcoats and caftans, similar to those worn in Western Europe. Only priests and peasants were allowed to wear long dresses and beards.
      Peter ordered that evenings with European dances and games, so-called assemblies, be held in the homes of his close associates.
      Under Peter I, Russia made significant progress, but remained a country where everything rested on serfdom and tsarist tyranny. The strengthening of the Russian Empire under Peter I was achieved at the expense of the deaths of hundreds of thousands of workers and the impoverishment of the people. Peter I did much to create and strengthen the state of landowners and merchants.
     
      30. The Noble Empire in the 18th Century
     
      . The Dominance of the Nobility. Peter I died in 1725. After Peter I's death, court noble circles, supported by noble guard regiments, plotted and dethroned emperors they disliked. Empresses Anna Ivanovna and Elizabeth Petrovna reigned the longest.
      Their reigns included several wars with Turkey, Sweden, and other states. From the newly captured lands, the nobles received new estates with peasants.
      Russian troops achieved particular fame during the Seven Years' War, when the German forces were routed and the city of Berlin was captured in 1760.
      In St. Petersburg, the nobles built magnificent palaces for themselves, hosting lavish celebrations and balls. The imperial court and Russian nobility now imitated the French kings and their courtiers in everything.
      The nobles learned to speak French, and the men dressed in French velvet waistcoats. Silk stockings hugged their legs. High-heeled shoes were adorned with precious buckles, and curled, powdered wigs were worn. The women wore expensive dresses of the finest silk and lace. Their hair was adorned with elaborate French hairstyles.
      The adorned nobles, with their powdered wigs, were neither able nor willing to work. But to work in factories and build palaces, the nobility needed scientists and specialists. They were invited from abroad, which was very expensive.

      Peter also conceived the idea of ​​founding the Academy of Sciences, which opened the year of his death. All the academicians were foreigners. Students were trained at the academy. But the nobility did not want to study, and peasants were not allowed into the academy.
      M.V. Lomonosov. A great Russian scientist was a peasant from the village of Denisovka (near Arkhangelsk) – Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov. From the far north, he reached Moscow and enrolled in school, posing as the son of a nobleman; otherwise, he would not have been accepted. Living hand to mouth, Lomonosov, through persistent work, completed an eight-year course of study at the age of five. The talented young man was sent abroad at government expense to continue his education. Upon his return to Russia, Lomonosov was appointed a member of the Academy of Sciences.
     
      The great Russian scientist, Academician M. V. Lomonosov (1711–1765).
     
      Lomonosov was an outstanding scientist in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. He made many major scientific discoveries. Lomonosov laid the foundations of Russian science and was the first to write literary works in pure Russian, purging it of many obsolete Slavic words.
      At Lomonosov's suggestion, the first university was founded in Moscow in 1755. A monument to M. V. Lomonosov now stands in the university courtyard. Lomonosov died in 1765, during the reign of Catherine II.
      Empress Catherine II. In 1762, the nobility placed Catherine II on the Russian throne, having assassinated her husband, Peter III, with her assistance.
      Under Catherine II, the rights of the nobility were further expanded. Catherine II distributed over a million peasants among the nobility. In order to finance their luxurious lifestyle, the nobility began to oppress the peasants even more.
      Corvee labor reached the point where peasants were forced to work for the landowner almost constantly. The landowner's serfs did everything—they were farmers, blacksmiths, cooks, footmen, hunters, even artists. The peasants were left only with holidays and nights to work for themselves. Under Catherine II, the quitrent increased almost fivefold.
      The nobles traded peasants. A woman cost 20–30 rubles, a literate man or artisan 100–200 rubles. A small child could be bought for 10–20 kopecks. Dogs were more valuable to the landowners. The
      landowners abused the peasants in every possible way. The landowner Saltychikha beat her serfs to death, scalded them with boiling water, and scorched their hair. She killed more than a hundred people.
      This terrible situation led the peasants to revolt.
     
      31. The Peasant War under the Leadership of Pugachev.
     
      The beginning and course of the peasant war. The Cossacks on the Yaik River (now the Ural River) were the first to rebel. The tsarist government deprived the Ural Cossacks of their liberties and imposed onerous taxes on them, seeking to turn them into serfs like the peasants of central Russia. Cossack elders exacted excessive taxes from rank-and-file Cossacks and pocketed their wages.
      In 1773, the Cossack poor rose up against their oppressors.
      The uprising was led by the Don Cossack Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachev, a strong, intelligent, and courageous man.
     
      Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachev.
     
      The Cossacks captured several fortresses and besieged Orenburg.
      Pugachev was joined by serf workers from the Ural factories. The peasants attached to the factories cursed the backbreaking labor they endured. Even at the beginning of Catherine II's reign, only about 50,000 of the 200,000 factory peasants participated in the uprising.
      Workers eagerly joined Pugachev's army. They supplied his troops with weapons, cannons, and cannonballs. The leaders of Pugachev's detachments, Khlopusha and Beloborodov, emerged from factory workers.
      At the same time, the Bashkirs joined the uprising. The nobles took land from the Bashkirs and established ironworks there. The plundered Bashkirs repeatedly rebelled, but the uprisings were suppressed.
      Now the Bashkirs rose up again and joined Pugachev's army with their cavalry. One of their leaders was Salavat Yulaev, a brave young rebel who greatly assisted Pugachev with his army.
      At the same time, serfs rebelled in the Volga region: Russians, Tatars, Chuvash, Mordvins, and Mari. Pugachev pretended to be Emperor Peter III. He claimed that the nobles and his wife, the villainous Catherine II, had failed to assassinate him and that he had escaped. In the name of Peter III, Pugachev signed orders and sent manifestos across the country calling for the extermination of the nobles, declaring that he was liberating the peasants from the rule of the landowners, military conscription, and taxes.
     
      Pugachev judges the landowners. From a painting by V.G. Perov.
     
      The entire Volga region and the Urals, as well as part of Siberia, were engulfed in rebellion. The landowners' estates were plundered. Peasants seized the landowners' lands, and the masters' grain reserves were taken to Pugachev's army.
      Pugachev and his troops approached Kazan and laid siege to the fortress.
      Catherine II's troops soon began to push back Pugachev's army. Pugachev was forced to retreat south down the Volga. The Volga cities in his path surrendered to Pugachev without a fight. But he couldn't gain a foothold there.
      The peasant rebellion was suppressed. In August 1774, Pugachev reached Tsaritsyn. A few days later, he was defeated in a battle with a detachment of tsarist troops and fled with the remnants of his army into the steppe. There, traitors from among the wealthy Cossacks handed him over to the tsarist authorities.
      Pugachev was chained and taken to Moscow in a large wooden cage. On January 10, 1775, executioners executed the brave leader of the peasant rebellion, Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachev, on Bolotnaya Square.
      Salavat Yulaev's nostrils were torn out, and the words "thief and murderer" were burned into his forehead with a hot iron. After this, he was brought to Bashkiria and flogged in every village where he led the rebellion. After brutal torture, Salavat Yulaev was exiled to hard labor.
      The peasants fought bravely and steadfastly, but, overwhelmed by the darkness, they had no clear idea of ​​what they were trying to achieve. Disunited, they were unable to create a strong organization or a sturdy army to fight.
      This is why the peasants and oppressed peoples were defeated.
     
      32. The annexation of new lands to Russia in the late 18th century.
     
      The annexation of Crimea. Suvorov. During the reign of Catherine II, Azov was recaptured from the Turks. Crimea, previously ruled by Tatar khans subservient to Turkey, was annexed to Russia. The naval fortress of Sevastopol, a stronghold of the Russian fleet on the Black Sea, was built in southern Crimea.
      The great Russian commander Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov gained fame in the war with the Turks.
      He began his military service as a simple soldier. Suvorov led a harsh lifestyle: he ate soldier's food and hardened himself.
      With 25,000 troops, Suvorov defeated a 100,000-strong Turkish army.
      Simultaneously with the annexation of Crimea, all of Left-Bank Ukraine was finally ceded to Russia. The Hetmanate in Ukraine was abolished. Russian troops entered the Zaporizhian Sich, and the Sich was destroyed forever. Its lands were seized by the tsar's generals. Some of the Zaporozhian Cossacks were transferred to Kuban (North Caucasus), some went to Turkey, and poor Cossacks and peasants were forced to work as serfs. Catherine II gave Ukrainian elders equal rights with Russian nobles.
     
      Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov (1730–1800).
     
      Partition of Poland. Poland was greatly weakened in the 18th century. Poland was ruled by the largest landowners, the lords, who were constantly at odds with each other. Royal power was weak.
      Taking advantage of the weakness of the Polish lords, Austria, Prussia, and Empress Catherine II agreed to divide the lands of the Polish state. During the partition of Poland, Belarusian and Ukrainian lands on the right bank of the Dnieper River ceded to Russia. Austria seized most of the land.
      In 1794, a Polish uprising for the restoration of Poland took place in Poland under the leadership of Kosciuszko. Austria, Prussia, and Russia sent their troops against him. Kosciuszko was defeated. In battle, he was seriously wounded and captured. Lithuania ceded Poland to Russia.
      From that time on, Poland ceased to exist as an independent state for many years.
      Conquests in Kazakhstan and the Far North. In the 18th century, the Kazakh pastoralists had three states—zhuzes. Khans and sultans ruled the zhuzes. Kazakh nobility and merchants traded with Russia and neighboring Central Asian states—Kokand and Bukhara—as well as with China. All these states sought to subjugate the Kazakhs, exploiting their internecine strife.
      The Kazakhs were first conquered by the Mongols. Mongol tribes enslaved and attacked the Kazakhs for approximately 200 years, until Kazakhstan's annexation by Russia. The Kazakhs repeatedly petitioned the Russian tsars to accept them as Russian subjects. In 1731, the Little Zhuz joined Russia at the request of Khan Abulkhayir. The Russian tsars, taking advantage of this, began to conquer all of Central Asia. Catherine II built fortresses in the conquered regions and stationed garrisons of Russian soldiers there. Tsarist agents pursued a policy of plundering Kazakh lands. The Kazakh people repeatedly rose up against the policies of tsarism.
      In 1783, the brave Sarym Datov rose to the head of the Kazakh rebellion. For fourteen years, the Kazakh people fought against their enemies under the leadership of their fearless leader, Sarym, who became a national hero. Sarym was killed, and the uprising was suppressed. Catherine's troops penetrated deep into the Kazakh steppes and built fortresses there. In the first half of the 19th century, all of Kazakhstan was annexed.
      By the end of the 18th century, the last lands of the northern peoples of Siberia were subjugated by Russian authorities. Tsarist troops penetrated the Bering Strait to North America and established Russian rule over Alaska. In the 19th century, the Russian tsars sold Alaska to the American government for a pittance, unaware of its abundance of gold.
      At the end of Catherine II's reign, the final conquest of Azerbaijan began.
     
      VIII. Tsarist Russia in the late 18th and first half of the 19th centuries
     
      33. The bourgeois revolution in France and the struggle against it of Catherine II and Paul I.
     
      The overthrow of royal power in France. At the end of the 18th century, major events occurred in Western Europe that affected the lives of all countries, including Russia. Revolution broke out in France. On July 14, 1789, a rebellious crowd in Paris stormed the royal prison, the Bastille. The prisoners were released. A revolutionary flag was raised on the Bastille.
      The revolution quickly spread throughout the country. Craftsmen, small tradesmen, and the then-sparse workforce rose up in every city. Peasants everywhere attacked noble estates, seized land, and demanded the complete abolition of serfdom. Many nobles fled abroad.
      Relying on the revolutionary people, the bourgeoisie seized power. The bourgeois revolution was victorious in France.
      King Louis XVI attempted to flee France. Catherine II ordered her ambassador in Paris to issue the king a Russian passport to enter Russia. However, the king was captured en route and returned to Paris.
     
      The rebellious people of Paris storm the royal prison, the Bastille.
     
      The feudal states of Austria and Prussia, supported by French nobles fleeing the revolution, began a war against bourgeois-revolutionary France. The king knew of the counterrevolutionary plans of the interventionists and secretly aided them.
      The revolutionary government of France organized the country's defense. A republic was declared in France, and Louis XVI was executed as a traitor.
      After the king's execution, the Jacobin revolutionaries, representing the interests of peasants and artisans, came to power in France. Their leaders were Robespierre and Marat, nicknamed the "friend of the people." Under the Jacobins, the peasants were finally freed from serfdom.
     
      Marat (1744–1803).
     
      The land was confiscated from the landowners by the revolutionary government and sold to anyone who wanted it. Much of the land was purchased by the peasants, but some of it fell into the hands of the bourgeoisie.
      The Jacobins were not consistent revolutionaries. They stood for private ownership of land, factories, and plants. They prohibited workers from striking and fighting the capitalists.
      The revolutionary people rose up to defend their country. The Republican army routed the interventionist forces and drove them out of France. Now, France's troops fought beyond its borders, liberating other nations from the rule of feudal kings and nobles.
      Fearing the growing power of bourgeois-democratic France, the powerful industrial country of England went to war with it.
      Domestic and foreign counterrevolutionaries fought the revolution with all means necessary. They sent assassins to the leaders of the revolution and killed Marat. The Jacobins then declared a merciless reign of terror against the enemies of the people.
      But soon, the French upper class managed to seize power again. The Jacobin leaders were executed. General Napoleon Bonaparte became the leader of bourgeois France.
      The bourgeois revolution liberated the French people from the rule of the king and the landowners, but established the rule of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie won because the working class in France was weak and disorganized, and the peasants, freed from the rule of the landowners with the help of the bourgeoisie, supported the bourgeoisie. The French Revolution destroyed the oppression of the landowners and strengthened that of the bourgeoisie—the capitalists.
      The struggle of Catherine II and Paul I against the bourgeois revolution. Catherine II feared that revolution would break out in her empire as well. There were already people in Russia who sympathized with the revolution. One of the most enlightened and progressive figures of the time, the nobleman Radishchev, wrote a book entitled "Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow," in which he openly opposed serfdom and autocracy and sympathized with the peasant uprisings against the landowners. Catherine II exiled Radishchev to Siberia and ordered his book burned.
      Catherine II considered the fight against the bourgeois revolution in France her primary task. She eagerly welcomed nobles fleeing France to Russia and ordered all Russians in Paris to leave. Catherine II aided all states at war with France. She gave Austria money and, having ceded part of Poland to Prussia, promised to send Russian troops to their aid and prepared her army for the campaign. Only her sudden death in 1796 prevented her from starting a war with bourgeois France.
     
      A. N. Radishchev (1719–1802).
     
      After the death of Catherine II, her son, Paul I, became tsar and continued the fight against the bourgeois revolution. He closed all private printing houses in Russia, forbade the reading of French books and the discussion of the revolution in France.
      Paul I began to wage war against France and sent Suvorov against it. Suvorov won several victories in northern Italy and made a heroic march across the Alps. However, his allies—Austria and Prussia—failed to aid Suvorov. The Russian army was left without provisions. Paul I recalled Suvorov's troops and concluded peace with France. By this time, Napoleon Bonaparte had staged a coup d'état in France against the revolution and became the sole ruler. Paul I, seeing that Napoleon was fighting the revolution, entered into an alliance with him.
      Negotiations with Napoleon led to Russia's break with England. From an ally of England, Paul became its enemy. Nobles, dissatisfied with Paul I's alliance with France, with the help of the English ambassador in St. Petersburg, plotted and assassinated Paul.
     
      34. Tsar Alexander I. The Patriotic War of 1812.
     
      Annexation of Georgia. His son, Alexander I, who ascended the throne after Paul's assassination, took part in the conspiracy against his father. Alexander I continued the conquest of the Black Sea shores and the rich lands of the Caucasus, begun by Peter I and Catherine II. He first consolidated his position in Georgia.
      In Georgia, as in Russia at the time, landowners reigned supreme. Peasants worked for them from dawn to dusk, never bending their backs. They lived in stone huts and dugouts. Most of the harvest from their fields and gardens was taken from them by their lords, the landowners. The rulers of Georgia's neighboring states (Turkey and Iran) carried out devastating raids on the rich Georgian lands, further impoverishing the peasants.
      After one attack, in which the Iranians took more than 10,000 Georgians captive, the king of Georgia appealed to Paul I for help. Tsarist troops were brought into the Georgian capital, Tbilisi; in 1801, Georgia finally joined Russia. The devastating raids of the Iranian kings on Georgia ceased.
      Georgia became a possession of Tsarist Russia. Russian officials were placed in courts and other institutions. They demanded that petitioners in all Georgian institutions speak only Russian, a language unknown to the Georgian people. Serfdom continued to exist in Georgia. Cruelly oppressed Georgian peasants repeatedly rebelled against their landlords and tsarist officials, but with the help of Georgian princes and nobles, the tsarist troops mercilessly suppressed them. Relying on the serf-owning Georgian nobles, Alexander I firmly established himself in Transcaucasia.
      He conquered Finland and Bessarabia. In 1805, Alexander I, having restored a military alliance with England, began a war with Napoleon I, who had declared himself Emperor of France.
      Napoleon defeated Alexander I's troops and demanded that Russia cease trade with England, France's main adversary. The defeated Alexander I was forced to agree. Napoleon promised in exchange not to interfere with the Russian Emperor's wars with Sweden and Turkey. Napoleon himself brought almost all the nations of Western Europe under French rule.
      Alexander I soon declared war on Sweden and quickly occupied Swedish-held Finland with his troops. The Russian army crossed the frozen Gulf of Bothnia in winter and threatened the Swedish capital. The Swedish king was obliged to make peace in 1809 and agreed to the cession of Finland to Russia.
      Three years later, Alexander I succeeded in recapturing Bessarabia—the region between the Dniester and Prut rivers—from Turkey.
      The Patriotic War of 1812. But Russia's alliance with France did not last long. The landowners and merchants were keen to secure free trade with England and demanded that the Tsar break with Napoleon. The nobles also feared that, under the influence of bourgeois France, where serfdom had been abolished, their hold on Russia would be weakened. Alexander I relented. Trade with England resumed.
      Then Napoleon, with a massive army of over 500,000 men, attacked Russia in the summer of 1812. The Russian forces numbered only about 200,000. They retreated, destroying all food and equipment along the way. Napoleon soon captured Lithuania and Belarus and advanced on Moscow. Napoleon's invasion of Russia roused the Russian people to wage a Patriotic War against the invaders; peasants began a guerrilla war.
      Ukrainians, Belarusians, Tatars, Bashkirs, and other peoples of our country participated in the fight against Napoleon.
      Suvorov's favorite student, the great military leader Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov, was placed at the head of the Russian army.
      At the end of August, the largest battle took place near Moscow, near the village of Borodino. Russian troops fought tenaciously against the enemy, who were devastating their country. More than 50 thousand Russians died in this bloody battle, but the strength of the Russian army was not broken.
      The French suffered enormous losses, but the odds were still in their favor. Kutuzov decided to surrender Moscow to Napoleon without a fight and retreat to preserve his army.
      The French occupied Moscow. Large fires broke out in the city. Many houses burned down. The French in Moscow were left without food.
     
      Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov (1745–1813).
     
      Winter was approaching. It was impossible for the French to hold on to Moscow. Napoleon and his army began to retreat along the road destroyed during the march on Moscow. His attempt to retreat by another route failed—other roads were occupied by Russian troops.
      Kutuzov relentlessly pursued Napoleon's retreating troops. Partisans attacked and destroyed individual French detachments. While crossing the Berezina River, Napoleon narrowly escaped the complete defeat of the remnants of his army and personal capture. Of Napoleon's vast army, only 30,000 men survived and returned from Russia abroad.
     
      1812. Retreat of the French army. From a painting by Pryanishnikov.
     
      Napoleon raised a new army and continued the war. But now, in alliance with Russia, Prussia, Austria, England, and Sweden opposed him. They defeated Napoleon near Leipzig. The allies crossed the French border and occupied Paris.
      Napoleon's victors restored the power of the old French kings and princes in France. The French were ruled by the brother of the king executed during the Revolution. Napoleon was exiled to a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean. In all the other European states previously conquered by Napoleon, the kings and princes he had driven out again came to rule.
      For his fight against Napoleon, the allies gave Alexander I part of Poland, including the city of Warsaw.
      To combat the revolution in Europe, the Russian Tsar, the King of Prussia, and the Emperor of Austria formed a reactionary Holy Alliance. They vowed to support each other in the fight against popular uprisings. The head of this alliance was the Russian Tsar Alexander I. Tsarist Russia became the gendarme of Europe.
     
      35. The Decembrists:
     
      Secret societies of noble revolutionaries. Alexander I kept a huge army under arms. Troops stationed closer to the European border were transferred to special military settlements, where they served in the army and, by cultivating the land, supported themselves. The commander of these settlements was the cruel and rude General Arakcheyev.
      The already difficult life of the soldiers, who had served in the army for 25 years, became worse than penal servitude. They spent their entire days either working in the fields or participating in military exercises. They were even married at the officers' discretion. For the slightest offense, soldiers and peasants were mercilessly beaten with sticks, often to death.
      The Tsar's arbitrary rule and the feudal system greatly outraged progressive members of the nobility. Many of them served as officers. During their foreign campaigns in France, they saw that the peasants lived better without serfdom, that hired labor on estates and in factories was more profitable than serfdom. They saw that in the cities of Western Europe, people lived wealthier and more cultured lives than in Russia.
      These nobles dreamed of a similar life in their homeland. They organized secret revolutionary societies: the "Northern Society" and the "Southern Society."
      Members of the "Northern Society" wanted to abolish serfdom—that is, the power of the nobility over the peasants—but decided to leave almost all the land to the landowners. They believed it was necessary to preserve the Tsar and only recognized the need to limit his power. The main leaders of this society were the poet and friend of Pushkin, Ryleyev, and the officers Trubetskoy and Kakhovsky.
      In Ukraine, among the tsarist troops, a "Southern Society" arose, led by the educated and courageous Colonel Pestel. He believed that the peasants should be given not only freedom but also land. Pestel wanted Russia to be a republic. He proposed assassinating the tsar and his family.
      But the members of these secret societies were nobles and were afraid to call the people to revolt. They remembered the peasant revolt against the nobility under Catherine II. They wanted to carry out a revolution only with the help of the troops they commanded.
      The Decembrist Rebellion. In 1825, Alexander I died. He had no children. His brother, Nicholas, was to reign.
      On the morning of December 14, 1825, officers—members of the "Northern Society" in St. Petersburg—led their regiments onto the square in front of the Senate and refused to swear allegiance to Tsar Nicholas I. Guards sailors joined them. The rebels awaited orders from their leader, Prince Trubetskoy. But he chickened out and didn't show up at the square, leaving the uprising leaderless. Nicholas summoned troops loyal to him and surrounded the rebel regiments with them.
      Serfs, artisans, and construction workers gathered around the rebels. They threw logs and stones at the soldiers who remained on Nicholas's side. But even here, the noble revolutionaries were afraid to accept their help.
     
      December 14, 1825, in St. Petersburg. Nicholas I ordered the cannons to fire at the rebels.
     
      Nicholas sent the governor to negotiate with the rebels. Officer Kakhovsky killed the governor. Nicholas I lacked confidence in his troops and hesitated for a long time to act by force. Only in the evening, when artillery arrived, did he order the cannons to fire at the rebels. Shots rang out. The rebels and the people fled. Hundreds of dead and wounded remained in the square.
      Two weeks later, near Kiev, officers from the Southern Society instigated a rebellion in the Chernigov Regiment in Ukraine. They led their regiment to join forces with other troops in the organization. Troops sent by Nicholas I to suppress the uprising routed the regiment.
      Having suppressed the rebellion, Nicholas I arrested its participants and dealt with them brutally. Five key leaders (Pestel, Ryleyev, Kakhovsky, Muravyov-Apostol, and Bestuzhev-Ryumin) were hanged. More than 100 conspiratorial officers were exiled to Siberia. Hundreds of soldiers were forced to run the gauntlet (each receiving several hundred blows with sticks), and many were exiled to hard labor and to active duty in the Caucasus.
      The noble revolutionaries who rebelled in December 1825 became known as Decembrists. They were few in number, and they had no connection with the people. But the Decembrists were the first to take up arms in an organized and open manner against the autocracy in the tsarist capital itself. Their cause did not perish. It was continued by subsequent generations of revolutionaries.
     
      P. I. Pestel, K. F. Ryleyev, M. P. Bestuzhev-Ryumin, S. I. Muravyov-Apostol, P. G. Kakhovsky—the five Decembrists executed by Nicholas I.
     
      Nicholas I, having become tsar, considered the fight against the revolution his primary task and in every possible way protected the old, feudal order.
     
      36. In the kingdom of gendarmes and officials,
     
      Nicholas I. About Tsar Nicholas I, when he was a boy, his teacher said: "I never saw a book in his hands: his only occupation was the front and the soldiers." Such a man became the Emperor of Russia.
      Nicholas I was greatly frightened by the uprising of December 14, 1825. To combat the revolution, he created a special police force—the gendarmes. The chief of the gendarmes reported only to the Tsar himself.
      The entire population was kept under strict surveillance. Gendarmes and secret police agents prowled the entire kingdom. They eavesdropped on all public gossip and private conversations. People were arrested at the slightest suspicion or on unverified denunciations.
      Nicholas I ruled Russia through noble officials, many of whom were bribe-takers and embezzlers. Officials in institutions and courts extorted bribes from the population, mocked, and abused people.
      Nicholas I established a brutal discipline in Russia. Under his rule, soldiers, peasants, and those arrested were beaten, as were anyone who opposed the landowners and princes. They were beaten with rods, lashes, whips, and sticks.
      Peasants were forced to work even harder for the landowners. All their land was confiscated, and corvee and quitrent were increased.
      The peasants couldn't stand such a life of hard labor and rebelled against the tyranny of the serf owners. They killed the most cruel landowners, set fire to and destroyed their estates, and refused to work corvée labor or pay quitrent. The peasant unrest continued.
      Tsarist troops and police mercilessly suppressed discontented peasants and dealt harshly with them.
      Life in Tsarist Russia was unbearably hard.
      Great Russian writers. The great Ukrainian poet Shevchenko. The brilliant Russian poet Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin lived under Nicholas I. He wrote wonderful works ("Eugene Onegin," "Boris Godunov," "The Captain's Daughter," and many others), which we are proud of to this day. Pushkin created Russian literature.
      Pushkin was born in 1799 in Moscow, into a noble family. As a boy, he began writing poetry. After graduating from the noble school – the lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo (now the town of Pushkin near Leningrad), he became a famous writer and became close to the Decembrists. In his poems, he sharply condemned serfdom and autocracy. Such poems were forbidden to be published; they were copied by hand, read secretly, and distributed everywhere.
     
      Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799–1837).
     
      Tsar Alexander I learned of these poems, and Pushkin was exiled first to the south, then to his village for two years. For the rest of his life, Pushkin was under constant surveillance by gendarmes. Life was especially difficult for him under Nicholas I, who knew of Pushkin's close relationship with the Decembrists. Pushkin's works were published only when Nicholas I himself permitted it.
      The Tsar hated Pushkin. The court nobility hounded and insulted the great poet. Nicholas I was well aware of this persecution, but took no action, even when it came to a duel. Pushkin fought a duel with one of his assailants and was killed by him in early 1837.
      Free thought had no place in the reign of the gendarmes. Nicholas I exiled another famous poet, Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov, to the Caucasus, serving with the army. The Tsar sent him to face the bullets of the highlanders for denouncing Pushkin's murderers—court parasites—in a poem. In the Caucasus, Lermontov was killed in a duel by a negligent officer. Upon learning of this, Nicholas I said, "A dog's death for a dog."
      The third greatest writer of the period, Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol, described the dominance and tyranny of Nicholas I's officials. His remarkable works, Dead Souls and The Government Inspector, vividly and truthfully depict the hard life of feudal Russia.
      Under Nicholas I, the famous Russian literary critic and revolutionary Vissarion Grigorievich Belinsky
     
      (1811–1848), hounded by gendarmes and suffering from tuberculosis, died.
     
      Life in Nicholas I's Russia was also difficult for the greatest Russian composer, M. I. Glinka. Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka composed the first national Russian opera, Ruslan and Lyudmila. In it, he conveyed the music of folk songs not only of the Russian people, but also of other peoples of Russia. The nobility did not understand the beauty of this remarkable work, and Glinka's opera soon ceased to be performed in theaters. Outraged, Glinka left Russia. He died abroad.
      Nicholas I also dealt cruelly with the Ukrainian revolutionary poet and artist Taras Grigorievich Shevchenko. Shevchenko was initially a serf and bought his freedom.
     
      Taras Grigorievich Shevchenko (1814–1861).
     
      In his poems, he wrote about the oppression of the Ukrainian and other peoples in Tsarist Russia, the hard lives of serfs, the arbitrary rule of tsars and lords, and the lack of rights of the people.
      Nicholas I conscripted Shevchenko into military service and exiled him to Kazakhstan, forbidding him even to write or draw. Shevchenko was tortured in the soldiers' barracks for ten years, but his spirit was not broken. He continued to secretly write poetry. It was only under Soviet rule that his poetry collection, "Kobzar," was published in full in Ukraine.
     
      37. Annexation of the Caucasus
     
      . Annexation of Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the early 19th century, Georgia joined Russia. Soon after, the annexation of Azerbaijan and Armenia, which had suffered for hundreds of years under the yoke of Iranian rulers, was completed. The Shah of Iran repeatedly attempted to recapture these lands. However, Russian troops defeated the Iranian forces each time.
      In addition to Iran, Turkey also frequently attacked Georgia and Armenia. Turkish troops destroyed cities and villages, stole livestock, devastated fields, slaughtered the population of entire cities, and took thousands of inhabitants into slavery.
      After Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia joined Russia, Turkey's plundering attacks began to be decisively rebuffed. Turkey could no longer plunder Georgians, Armenians, and Azerbaijanis with impunity. The Turkish sultan then conceived of raising the small, backward mountain tribes to war against Russia. The mountain tribes lived in the high, inaccessible Caucasus Mountains. These mountains hampered Russia's relations with Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Very few roads passed through the mountains. If the mountain tribes waged war against Russia, it would be easier for Turkey to attack Transcaucasia again.
      The highlander movement led by Shamil. The fragmented highlander tribes were ruled by various princes and landowners. One of the wealthy highlanders, Shamil, declared himself the ruler of all the tribes. He began to incite Muslims against the Russians and recruit backward highlanders into his forces. Shamil relied on landowners and princes who hated Russia. The Turkish Sultan bribed Shamil, giving him money, weapons, and promising troop support. England also aided Shamil. It sought to weaken Russia and seize the Caucasus. England was already a cruel oppressor of many millions of people in Asia, Africa, and other countries. The capture of the Caucasus by England or Turkey would have been a great disaster for the peoples of the Caucasus.
      Shamil's troops constantly attacked Kuban stanitsas and Georgian villages. Shamil captured many peasants during his raids, executing them or enslaving them. Shamil's raids intensified especially when Russia's war with Turkey, England, and France began in 1853. Russian troops had a difficult time fighting Shamil's troops, who hid in impregnable gorges and dense mountain forests after raids. However, Russian troops still prevailed against Shamil's troops.
      Shamil's defeat and the final annexation of the Caucasus. At first, Shamil succeeded in deceiving the highland masses by pretending he was waging a war of liberation for independence. But then the people saw through this deception. They saw that this war was bringing them only suffering and ruin. The highlanders also did not want to be under the rule of Turkey and England. The progressive people of the Caucasus strove for unification with Russia.
      The masses were dissatisfied with the brutal rule Shamil and the officials he installed over the highlanders and their impoverishment. Shamil wanted to force the highlanders to continue the war against Russia through mass executions. He exterminated entire villages of discontented highlanders. But the people did not submit to Shamil. Shamil's troops began to thin. On a high mountain in the village of Gunib (Dagestan), Shamil was surrounded by Russian troops and captured. Soon after, the Caucasus was finally annexed to Russia. The peoples of the Caucasus gained security from external enemies.
      The tsarist government, having defeated Shamil, did not free the highlanders of the Caucasus from the oppression of local landowners. Moreover, the tsar established the rule of his officials there.
      However, the annexation of the peoples of the Caucasus to Russia helped them come into closer contact with the Russian people. They became acquainted with advanced Russian culture. Subsequently, the peoples of the Caucasus fought together with the Russian people against the tsar, landowners, and capitalists.
     
      38. The Revolution of 1848 in Europe. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
     
      The Revolution of 1848 and Nicholas I. By the mid-19th century, industry in Europe had already developed significantly. Large industrial centers emerged in a number of countries, with numerous factories and plants equipped with new machinery, and railroads were rapidly being built. Manufacturers and plant owners reaped enormous profits. Rich millionaires emerged, wielding power and authority within the state.
      Growing industry required ever more labor. A large working class, previously absent, emerged—the proletariat. It began an open struggle against the capitalists for its rights. The Parisian proletariat gained particular prominence in the Revolution of 1848. On
      February 22, 1848, a revolution broke out in Paris and quickly engulfed the cities of France. The king fled abroad. A bourgeois republic was declared in France.
      But the revolution in France brought no relief to the workers. At the end of June 1848, the Parisian proletariat rose up against their capitalist masters and the bourgeois republican government. For three days, the workers fought heroically. Their wives and children made lead bullets, helped build barricades, and carried food to the fighters under fire from soldiers. The bourgeoisie moved well-armed troops against the workers. The workers were poorly organized, lacked weapons, and lacked peasant support, and the uprising was suppressed. The bourgeoisie dealt harshly with the vanquished: thousands were shot, imprisoned, and exiled to hard labor. The bourgeoisie celebrated its victory.
     
      The June uprising of Parisian workers in 1848.
     
      At the first news of the revolution in Paris and unrest in Prussia and Austria, Nicholas I moved his army to the border of Prussia and Austria. He bided his time to crush the hated revolutionary movement with his troops.
      Following France, revolution erupted in many European countries. In the Austrian capital, Vienna, rebellious workers, students, and other citizens overthrew the rule of the nobility. The Emperor fled Vienna.
      In Berlin, revolutionary workers fought on the barricades for 18 hours and forced the king to yield. A new government was formed in Prussia, and serfdom was abolished.
      Workers and citizens rebelled against kings, nobles, and, to some extent, capitalists in other European countries as well.
      The revolution engulfed part of the Austrian Empire—Hungary—and Nicholas I, at the request of the Emperor of Austria, sent his troops there and suppressed the revolution.
      Thus, Tsar Nicholas I, the gendarme of Europe, fought the revolution.
      But no force could suppress the young class that rose up in the 1848 revolution—the proletariat.
      Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marx and Engels were brilliant teachers and leaders of the proletariat.
      In 1848, they emerged as leaders of the revolutionary workers in Germany. Marx was then 30 years old, and his friend Engels was 28. They were the first communist revolutionaries and, even before the revolution, founded the "Communist League" and wrote the famous "Communist Manifesto." In this manifesto, they called on workers all over the world to fight their enemies—the capitalists. Since then, their call "Workers of the world, unite!" has become the banner of workers all over the world.
     
      Karl Marx (1818–1883).
     
      Friedrich Engels (1820–1895).
     
      After the defeat of the revolution in Germany, Marx and Engels were forced to leave Germany and settled in England. They had to live and work in difficult conditions. Marx's family was in great need. Engels helped his friend as much as he could and shared his failures and joys.
      But the hard life did not break the great revolutionaries. They tirelessly continued the great work they had begun to liberate the working people from the oppression of the capitalists.
      They wrote many books from which workers learned how to fight the capitalists and how to defeat them.
      Marx and Engels taught workers that a fierce struggle has always raged between the oppressed and the oppressors. Under capitalism, such a struggle is inevitable between the bourgeoisie and the workers, and it must end in the victory of the working class. The working class will overthrow the power of the bourgeoisie and establish its revolutionary power—the dictatorship of the proletariat. The victorious proletariat will build a new society—a communist society in which there will be neither classes nor oppression of people.
      Marx and Engels called on workers of all countries to unite in a single powerful communist party.
     
      39. Tsarist Russia before the reform of 1861.
     
      Industrial development. Until the mid-19th century, industry in feudal Russia developed slowly. Only one tenth of the country's total population lived in cities. Only 500,000 workers worked in factories and mills. Among them were many serfs, freed by landowners on quitrent and hired to work in factories. Machines and steam engines were just beginning to be installed in factories. Only the first steamships appeared on the Volga and Dnieper. Only one major railroad had been built—between Moscow and St. Petersburg.
      Manufacturers and plant owners were unable to build many factories and mills, as there were few free people available to become hired laborers. Moreover, selling goods in Russia was difficult; serfs bought little.
      The growing urban population and the growing number of factories and mills strengthened Russia's domestic grain trade. Landowners exported much Russian grain abroad, especially to industrial England. Wanting more grain to sell, they began to oppress the serfs even more.
      Many landowners realized that serfdom was hindering the development of the landowners' economy, that hired laborers worked the land better and were cheaper to maintain. They began to talk about the need to abolish serfdom.
      The Crimean War. To gain complete control of the Black Sea coast, to finally drive the Turks out of the Caucasian lands, and to freely transport the landowners' grain through the straits to Europe, Nicholas I launched a new war in 1853 with Turkey, which had weakened by that time. But England and France did not want Russia to grow stronger and defeat Turkey. They formed an alliance and declared war on Nicholas I.
      The allied fleet entered the Black Sea. Their warships had steam engines and powerful artillery, while Nicholas I had only a sailing fleet. The enemy landed a large army in Crimea and laid siege to Sevastopol. The enemy was armed with cannons and rifles that could fire twice as far as the Russians'. Such was the military technology of a backward, feudal Russia. The tsarist generals didn't even have a good map of Crimea. The army's supplies were in the hands of bribe-takers and embezzlers.
      The naval fortress of Sevastopol had no land-based fortifications. In a short time, the population and troops built earthen ramparts and installed batteries on the hills. Nicholas I's sailing fleet was unable to engage the enemy fleet. The Russians sank their ships at the entrance to Sevastopol harbor—the enemy fleet could no longer enter.
      The siege of Sevastopol lasted 11 months. Admiral Nakhimov led the defense of Sevastopol. Russian soldiers fought heroically, stubbornly defending the city. Finally, the main fortification—Malakhov Kurgan, known as the door to Sevastopol—was captured by the French after a brutal bombardment.
      Sevastopol was completely destroyed. It was no longer possible to hold out. The garrison abandoned the ruins of the fortress. The defeat of Nicholas I's Russia was complete. Nicholas I died unexpectedly during the siege of Sevastopol. Alexander II became tsar.
      In 1856, peace was concluded in Paris. Russia was forbidden to have a navy or fortresses on the Black Sea. However, Sevastopol remained Russian.
      Russia's defeat in the Crimean War exposed the extreme backwardness of feudal Russia.
      After the war, peasant unrest broke out throughout the country, and Tsar Alexander II declared at a meeting of the nobility: it was better to liberate the peasants "from above" than to wait for them to rebel and liberate themselves "from below."
      A. I. Herzen. The writer and democrat Alexander Ivanovich Herzen resolutely spoke out against serfdom and the tsar's arbitrary rule.
     
      Alexander Ivanovich Herzen (1812–1870).
     
      Nicholas I exiled Herzen from the capital. Returning from exile, Herzen went abroad. Here, together with his friend Ogarev, during the reign of Alexander II, Herzen began publishing the magazine "Kolokol" (The Bell) at the first free Russian printing house in London. In the magazine, he passionately defended the cause of the liberation of the peasantry and oppressed peoples. People were arrested and exiled to Siberia for reading "Kolokol," which was secretly brought to Russia.
     
      IX. The Rise of Capitalism in Tsarist Russia
     
      40. The Abolition of Serfdom in Russia.
     
      The Manifesto of Alexander II, February 19, 1861. Tsar Alexander II, fearing that the peasants would revolt and smash the serfdom system from below, signed the Manifesto on February 19, 1861, emancipating the peasants. The peasants were declared free; they could not be bought or sold; they ceased to be the property of the nobility.
      However, the peasants were left with little land—less than they had before the reform. The land they were given was poor, and the landlords took the best land for themselves. The landlords carved out for themselves the land the peasants needed, such as forests, meadows, and pastures. The landlords divided the land in such a way that the landlords' fields separated the peasants' lands from the roads to watering holes, forests, and pastures. The peasants were forced to beg the landlords to allow them to use the landlords' plots under any conditions they desired.
      The peasants were forced to pay the landlords a ransom for their land and their liberation, with the land being valued at double or triple its original value. Over the course of more than forty years, the peasants paid the landlords around two billion rubles in ransom for their liberation.
      The tsar and the landlords robbed the peasants even more in Crimea, Ukraine, and the Caucasus. In Crimea, they took all the best land along the Black Sea coast. Here were the palaces and estates of the tsar, the royal family, and the court nobility, who kept all the land for themselves. Peasants in Ukraine also received very little land. Landowners were unwilling to give up their fertile black soil. In Georgia, peasants, in addition to a huge ransom, were forced to continue to work for landowners for many years, giving them one-third of the harvest from their vineyards and fields.
      This abolition of serfdom sparked widespread peasant unrest throughout the country. The peasants demanded complete freedom and the transfer of the necessary land free of charge. Troops were sent in to suppress the peasants, and bloody clashes ensued, resulting in hundreds of dead and wounded.
      N. G. Chernyshevsky. The interests of the peasants were defended by the best, most educated people of the time. One of them was the great Russian scholar and populist revolutionary Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky. Even as a child, he observed the difficult life of serfs and Volga barge haulers. During the preparation of the reform, Chernyshevsky wrote many articles demanding that the peasants be given complete freedom and all the landowners' land free of charge.
     
      Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky (1828–1889).
     
      Following the February 19 Manifesto, Chernyshevsky, along with other populist revolutionaries, called on peasants to revolt against the tsar and the landowners. To this end, Chernyshevsky wrote an appeal, "To the Master's Peasants," which was intercepted by the tsar's gendarmes.
      Alexander II imprisoned Chernyshevsky in the Peter and Paul Fortress and then exiled him to hard labor. The staunch revolutionary did not renounce his beliefs, and the tsar kept him in a Siberian prison and in exile for 19 years. Marx, Engels, and Lenin highly valued Chernyshevsky as an outstanding scholar and a steadfast and courageous populist revolutionary.
     
      Nikolai Alekseevich Nekrasov (1821–1877).
     
      Poet N. A. Nekrasov. During these same years, the talented Russian poet Nikolai Alekseevich Nekrasov wrote his poetry. His simple verse vividly depicts the bitter life of peasants in Tsarist Russia. He wrote about the cruelty suffered under serfdom and the merciless exploitation of peasants by landowners and capitalists after the reform. "Instead of the chains of serfdom, people invented many others," Nekrasov wrote.
      Nekrasov's poems were favorite songs of revolutionaries of the time. They are still sung by the Russian people today.
      Changes in governance. Under serfdom, the landowner himself governed and judged his peasants.
      After the Peasant Reform, a village elder was appointed to govern each village. Several villages and hamlets were united into a volost, governed by a volost elder. The volost elder and village elders were chosen from among wealthy peasants. They were subordinate to tsarist officials, extorted taxes from the peasants, and assisted the police in pacifying the peasants. In the volosts, volost judges were elected, who judged peasants in minor cases. Volost judges could sentence peasants to flogging, fines, and arrest. Corporal punishment was retained for peasants and criminals.
      Zemstvo councils were elected in the provinces and districts, overseeing schools, hospitals, and bridge and road repairs. The peasants paid for all of this. Few peasants were elected to the zemstvo councils—one person per 3,000 households. Peasant representatives on the zemstvo councils were mostly kulaks. Landowners ran all affairs in the zemstvo councils. In the cities, city dumas were created to manage municipal affairs, with the right to vote granted only to factory owners, merchants, and wealthy homeowners.
      The military service system was changed. Everyone over 21 years of age was now eligible for conscription. The term of permanent military service was reduced to six years. But as before, peasants served in the army as simple soldiers, and nobles as officers.
      Even after the reform, the tsar and landowners retained power, owning vast tracts of the best land and keeping the peasants under the strict supervision of the police and officials.
      But with the abolition of serfdom in Russia, more new factories and plants appeared, railways were built more quickly, and trade began to develop more widely. Serfdom-ridden Russia was becoming a capitalist country.
     
      41. The Poles' Struggle for Independence. The Wars of Alexander II
     
      . The Polish Uprising of 1863. For many years, the Poles, led by the Polish nobility, had been preparing to liberate Poland from the rule of the Russian tsar. In Warsaw, revolutionaries formed the "People's Committee," which prepared the uprising.
      The "People's Committee," created by the Polish nobility, launched an uprising in 1863 and declared itself the Polish government.
      The uprising engulfed Poland, part of Lithuania, and part of Belarus. Rebel detachments gathered everywhere. The rebels were armed with pistols, hunting rifles, pikes, and sabers. Avoiding pitched battles with large detachments of Russian troops, they resorted to guerrilla warfare. Rebel units hid in forests and from there attacked the tsarist troops. Over a thousand such small battles took place over the course of a year and a half.
      The uprising was particularly powerful in Belarus. Here, under the leadership of Kastus Kalinovsky, peasants armed with scythes and axes burned landowners' estates, exterminated small detachments of Russian troops, and killed landowners, tsarist officials, and officers.
      Alexander II sent an entire army to suppress the uprising. Only after 18 months were the tsarist generals able to crush the bravely fighting rebels. In Belarus and Lithuania, the brutal General Muravyov led the suppression. He mercilessly hanged prisoners. The brave Kastus Kalinovsky was also captured and hanged.
      After suppressing the uprising, the tsarist government exiled tens of thousands of Poles to Siberia.
      During the uprising, Tsar Alexander II hastened to issue a law abolishing serfdom in Poland and Lithuania under less oppressive conditions for the peasants than in other Russian provinces: peasant dues were abolished, and in Lithuania, peasants received their former land plots for a lower yen than in other provinces, while in Poland, they received them for free. The tsar needed this to win over the peasants against the Polish landlords.
      Conquest of Central Asia. At the same time, Tsar Alexander II began decisive conquests in Central Asia.
      Having consolidated his position in captured Kazakhstan, Tsarist Russia conquered Kyrgyzstan within 10 years. The Kyrgyz stubbornly resisted Russian troops, but their resistance was broken.
      Moving along the Syr Darya River, Russian troops began advancing on the Uzbek city of Tashkent. The Uzbeks fiercely defended their lands, and the Russians were forced to take Tashkent twice. They only fortified their position in 1865.
      Three years after occupying Tashkent, Russian troops captured the ancient city of Bukhara—Samarkand (once the capital of Tamerlane). The ruler of Bukhara, the emir, acknowledged the authority of the Russian tsar and was forced to surrender his fertile lands. The
      Khan of Khiva's lands were then subjugated. The khan also acknowledged his allegiance to the Russian tsar. Following this, the Kokand Khanate was conquered.
      The warlike tribes of Turkmenistan fought the tsar's troops for 12 years for their independence. They repelled strong Russian forces from their main fortress, Geok-Tepe, and yielded it only after a crushing Russian offensive with powerful artillery. Ashgabat was then occupied by tsarist troops.
      At the end of the 19th century, Russia conquered the Pamir Mountains—the "roof of the world."
      Thus, over the course of 30 years of persistent warfare, Tsarist Russia conquered the lands of the peoples of Central Asia.
      Following the Russian troops, tsarist officials and merchants moved into Central Asia. They exacted heavy taxes from the population, confiscated their lands and property, cheated them, and defrauded them in trade. Khans, elders, and mullahs bribed by the tsar aided them in plundering the conquered peoples.
      Cotton from American seeds began to be grown on favorable lands. Cotton was needed for Russia's growing textile factories. All the profits from cotton cultivation fell into the hands of local wealthy individuals and Russian factory owners, who profited from the labor of the enslaved poor—Uzbeks, Turkmens, and Tajiks.
      The peoples of Central Asia were completely at the mercy of tsarist generals, nobles, and capitalists. The oppressed masses repeatedly rebelled, but the Russian nobles prevailed, aided by the wealthy indigenous population.
      Central Asia became a colony of tsarist Russia.
      War with Turkey. At the end of the reign of Alexander II (in 1877), Russia fought a war with Turkey. The Russian tsar failed to seize the straits from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean this time as well. Under the peace treaty with Turkey, Russia received the major trading port of Batumi on the Black Sea. As a result of this war, the Slavic peoples of the Balkans (Bulgarians, Serbs, and others), as well as Romania, were liberated from Turkish rule. Despite Russia's enormous superiority over Turkey, Russia's backwardness led to enormous losses in the war: hundreds of thousands of poorly armed soldiers died in vain.
     
      42. The First International and the Paris Commune
     
      The First International. Marx and Engels considered the revolutionary movement of European workers in 1848 to be only the beginning of the proletariat's struggle for liberation. They knew this struggle would be difficult and that the bourgeoisie would defend its dominance. The great leaders of the proletariat believed that to successfully combat the bourgeoisie, the proletariat needed to organize its own international party. Therefore, they created the first international association of the proletariat.
      In 1864, at a congress of workers' representatives in London, at the suggestion of Marx and Engels, the International Workingmen's Association—the First International—was founded. Karl Marx was the leader of the First International. The First International united the workers' movement of various countries. Marx developed a unified program for this movement. For nearly ten years, Marx led the First International and organized the working masses. Engels was his faithful assistant.
      Marx and Engels stubbornly and persistently defended the interests of the working class and waged a constant struggle against all who pointed the proletariat to false and harmful paths. Marx and Engels tirelessly exposed those who, calling themselves socialists but in fact being supporters of the capitalists and traitors to the workers, convinced workers that socialism could be built peacefully, without overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie. Marx and Engels also tirelessly explained the enormous harm caused by those who considered themselves revolutionaries but opposed the establishment of workers' power, the dictatorship of the proletariat. They argued that such views benefited only the enemies of the working class, the capitalists. These views were harmful because they reconciled workers to capitalist exploitation, weakened the proletariat, and made it easier for the capitalists to deal with them.
      The Paris Commune. In 1870, war broke out between Prussia and France. Prussia emerged victorious in this war. The French troops were routed. The French Emperor Napoleon III and his army were captured. A revolution of workers and petty-bourgeois urban masses began in Paris. But the bourgeoisie came to power. Prussian troops advanced on Paris. An armed citizen's army, the "National Guard," was then formed in Paris, consisting largely of workers.
      The Germans approached Paris and laid siege. Workers' battalions rose up to defend their city and vowed to die rather than surrender it to the enemy. Surrounded by enemy troops, the population of Paris steadfastly held out for four and a half months. Workers and their families starved. The bourgeois government, fearing a workers' uprising against the bourgeoisie, committed outright treason—secretly, it negotiated with the Germans to surrender Paris. But the workers remained armed. German troops, seeing the formidable strength of the Parisian workers, did not dare enter the city.
      Then the bourgeois government minister, a despicable traitor and enemy of the people, Thiers, sent a detachment of soldiers to suddenly seize the cannons from the workers. But the working women noticed the detachment's approach and raised the alarm. The National Guard recaptured the cannons. Many soldiers defected to the people and promptly executed two of their generals. Then Thiers, the ministers, generals, the bourgeoisie, speculators, officials, and priests fled Paris for Versailles.
      On March 18, 1871, power in Paris passed into the hands of the working class. The working class formed its own government—the Paris Commune. Some of the members of the Paris Commune were socialists, members of the First International.
      Marx and Engels called on the Commune to attack Versailles, where Thiers' bourgeois government had taken refuge. But the Commune hesitated to take such a step. The indecisiveness of the Paris Commune can be explained by the fact that it included many hesitant petty-bourgeois revolutionaries who believed in the "good intentions" of the bourgeoisie. Marx harshly criticized this indecision. Meanwhile, Thiers' troops formed a tight encirclement around Paris.
      The Commune handed over the factories to the fleeing bourgeoisie. Churches and monasteries were converted into public clubs. Everything was done to improve the workers' situation. An order was issued for workers to move from dark and damp basements to the homes of the rich.
      The entire world tensely followed the great struggle of the Parisian proletariat. But the Communards were under siege, cut off from the rest of France. They failed to forge an alliance of workers and peasants against the bourgeoisie, and they failed to win over the peasantry.
      The Communards fought heroically against the numerous and well-armed troops of the Versailles bourgeois government. Women and children fought alongside men. On May 21, Thiers' troops stormed Paris. German troops assisted Thiers. The bourgeoisie dealt brutally with the Communards. Within a week, tens of thousands of men, women, and children were shot. Even more workers were imprisoned and exiled to distant islands for hard labor.
     
      A battle between the Communards and Thiers' troops in a Paris square.
     
      The Paris Commune was crushed. It lasted 71 days and forever remained in the memory of the proletariat. Every year, workers lay wreaths at the Communards' graves in one of the Parisian cemeteries, where the heroes of the Commune were shot against the wall.
      The Paris Commune perished because the workers did not yet have their own workers', Marxist, revolutionary party, capable of unhesitatingly leading the workers against the bourgeoisie. And also because the workers did not have the support of the peasants and did not understand the importance of an alliance between the workers and the peasants. Five years after the fall of the Paris Commune, in 1876, the First International ceased to exist.
      The significance of the First International was enormous. It was the first international workers' union, serving as a model for the Communist International founded by Lenin.
      Karl Marx died in 1883, and Engels in 1895. Their teachings set the workers' struggle for communism on the right path and formed the basis of the work of V. I. Lenin and our Communist Party.
     
      43. Capitalism in Russia
     
      . The life of workers and peasants under capitalism. After the reform of 1861, tens of millions of peasants continued to live in terrible poverty and without rights. They had little land. To feed themselves and pay taxes, the peasants were forced to lease land from landowners or borrow money from them. The landowners forced the peasants to cultivate the land with the peasants' horses and tools under oppressive conditions.
      The landowners, like spiders, sucked everything they could from the peasants. By the end of the 19th century, half of all peasants had become poor, either having no horses at all, or having one emaciated horse. The middle peasants still managed their farms somehow. If there was a crop failure or crop failure, the middle peasants became impoverished, fell into even greater dependence on the landowners and the kulak peasants, and were forced to work for them as farmhands.
     
      Barge haulers on the Volga. From a painting by I. E. Repin.
     
      In addition to the landowners, the peasants were robbed and oppressed by the kulaks. The ruined peasants fled to the cities. The cities grew rapidly, and industry developed in them. By the end of the 19th century, there were already more than 2 million workers in Russia. Large industrial centers were formed: in St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod (now the city of Gorky) - machine-building plants; in Tula, in the Urals and in the Donetsk Basin - metallurgical plants; Textile factories flourished in the Moscow, Vladimir, Kostroma, and Yaroslavl provinces.
      Impoverished peasants flocked to these areas. Many workers were also needed for railroad construction. By the end of the 19th century, Russia already had over 30,000 kilometers of railroads, and construction had begun on a road across Siberia.
      Hundreds of thousands of peasant families flocked to the vast Siberian lands. In Siberia's harsh natural conditions, they toiled tirelessly to develop this rich region. Peasants penetrated the remote taiga. Russia's ancient holdings were populated en masse by impoverished peasants.
      Life for the workers was no better. Factory owners and manufacturers forced workers—not only men, but also women and children—to work 13–14 hours a day. Often, the workday lasted 17–18 hours. They were forced to work even on holidays. There were no vacations.
      Such backbreaking labor was paid a pittance, because crowds of hungry people stood at the gates of factories and plants, begging for work.
     
      The workers demanded that their employers raise their wages.
     
      Workers were fined for every possible reason—a portion of their wages was withheld. The factories were dirty, damp, and dark; there weren't even any vents in the windows.
      Workers lived in cramped, filthy barracks-like buildings, where workers from different shifts slept on the same beds: as soon as one woke up, another would lie down.
      In Tsarist Russia, both workers and peasants were equally disenfranchised. But the workers in the factories and plants were the first to unite and rise up against their oppressors. And then the peasants—the Narodniks—followed them.
      Many Russian revolutionaries of the time failed to understand the vanguard role of the working class. They incorrectly believed that all power lay in the peasantry and that liberation from the rule of the tsar and the landowners could be achieved through a peasant uprising alone. They failed to understand that peasants alone, without an alliance with the working class, could not defeat tsarism and the landowners.
      Soon after the 1861 peasant reform, these revolutionaries began secretly organizing revolutionary circles of young people, mostly students, in many Russian cities. These circles heatedly discussed how to help the peasantry. It was decided to go to the villages ("to the people," as they said at the time) and call on the peasants to revolt against the tsar and the landowners. That's why these revolutionaries were called Narodniks. But the peasants didn't follow them.
      The Narodniks then decided to continue the struggle without the people, using their own forces. They planned to begin by assassinating the tsar and organized a secret society called "Narodnaya Volya." They spent much time and effort preparing the assassination. Only on March 1, 1881, did the Narodniks succeed in killing Alexander II with a bomb.
      But nothing came of it. In place of one murdered tsar or minister, another, even more vicious, arose. Alexander II's son, Alexander III, became tsar, under whom life became even worse for the workers and peasants. Almost all of the Narodnaya Volya revolutionaries were tracked down and arrested by the tsarist gendarmes. By order of Alexander III, five of them were hanged, while the others were imprisoned for life in a fortress or exiled to hard labor.
      The Narodniks' failure was no accident. The path they chose to fight tsarism, the path of terror, was mistaken and very harmful to the revolution. The Narodniks'
      activities were harmful because they prevented the working class from understanding its leading role in the revolution and hindered the creation of a Marxist workers' party. They distracted workers from the struggle against the entire oppressor class with the useless assassinations of individual members of that class, and they hindered the creation of a workers' and peasants' alliance.
      In 1887, a small group of revolutionaries again attempted to assassinate the tsar (Alexander III), but failed. The organizers of the assassination—Lenin's older brother, Alexander Ulyanov, and his comrades—were captured by the gendarmes and hanged. A second mistake brought the same harm.
      Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin) was already 17 years old at the time. Upon learning of his brother's execution, he said, "No, we won't go that way. This is not the way to go." Lenin was right. Only an organized working class, in alliance with the peasantry, leading the peasantry, could achieve complete victory over the power of the tsar and the landowners.
      Russian scientists, writers, and artists. The second half of the 19th century saw many talented scientists, writers, artists, and composers.
      Great Russian scientists lived during this time. Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev made outstanding discoveries in chemistry. He worked extensively to study the natural resources of our country. Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov was the first to scientifically explain the workings of the human brain. Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky discovered the laws essential to aircraft construction. He is called the "father of Russian aviation." Alexander Stepanovich Popov invented the radio.

      Ilya Efimovich Repin (1844–1930).
     
      Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy (1828–1910).
     
      The greatest Russian writer, Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy, began writing his works at a young age, when he participated in wars with the highlanders of the Caucasus and in the defense of Sevastopol during the Crimean War. Tolstoy wrote his most significant works after leaving military service and settling on his estate, Yasnaya Polyana (near the city of Tula). His main work, War and Peace, vividly depicts Russia's war with Napoleon I in 1812. In his works, Tolstoy described the lives of landowners under serfdom and under the capitalist system. Towards the end of his life, he began writing about the desperate situation of the peasants after the 1861 reforms. Tolstoy was not a supporter of the revolution. But he witnessed the hard life of the peasants and castigated the tyranny of tsarist officials, landowners, and capitalists.
      The great Russian artists Ilya Efimovich Repin and Vasily Ivanovich Surikov also lived during this period. Repin was born in Ukraine to a soldier's family and loved to draw from childhood. Surikov was born in Siberia to a Cossack family. Repin and Surikov understood the peasants' lives well, as they themselves came from the common people. Their paintings are known throughout the world.
      The second half of the 19th century saw the birth and creation of major musical works by the great Russian composers Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin, and Tchaikovsky.
      Mussorgsky wrote the opera Boris Godunov, and Rimsky-Korsakov wrote The Snow Maiden and Sadko. In their operas, they made extensive use of songs from the peoples of Russia. We often listen to all these wonderful works even today.
     
      44. The Labor Movement of the 1970s–1990s. V. I. Lenin
     
      . The First Workers' Unions. Even under Tsar Alexander II, workers began to fight against the capitalists.
      Workers would collectively present demands to the factory or plant owner for improvements in their situation and refuse to begin work until the owner met these demands. This was called a strike.
      To more effectively fight the capitalists, workers began to unite in unions.
      The first, the "South Russian Union," was founded in Odessa in 1875. The union prepared for the fight against the autocracy and called on workers to unite for revolution. But its members were soon arrested. Its leader, Zaslavsky, was exiled to hard labor, where he died.
      Three years later, the "Northern Union of Russian Workers" was organized in St. Petersburg, led by carpenter Khalturin and mechanic Obnorsky. This union had already begun to participate in workers' strikes and led them. The tsarist government also crushed this workers' union.
      But the labor movement spread to more and more regions. Life became increasingly difficult for workers, and capitalists robbed them more and more.
      The manufacturer Morozov mercilessly fined his workers. Under the guise of fines, he confiscated one-third of their earnings. In 1885, eight thousand workers at Morozov's textile factory in Orekhovo-Zuyevo could not stand this plundering and went on strike. The factory shut down.
      This strike had been pre-organized. It was led by a leading worker, Moiseenko, who had previously been a member of the Northern Union of Russian Workers. Together with a group of his fellow weavers, he wrote demands to the factory owner, and the workers approved these demands at a secret meeting.
     
      A workers' meeting before Morozov's strike.
     
      Morozov refused to fulfill the workers' demands and secured the arrest of one of their leaders. A crowd of weavers forcibly freed their arrested comrade. Morozov called in troops to the factory, who routed the workers. 600 striking workers were arrested, several dozen of whom were put on trial.
      Similar strikes occurred in many factories across Russia. The following year, the tsarist government, frightened by the growing labor movement and strikes, was forced to issue a law preventing factory owners from so brazenly cheating workers.
      Workers realized they could achieve much through organized struggle.
      Advanced Russian workers first began to become acquainted with the teachings of Marx and Engels through workers' circles and unions.
      The "Emancipation of Labor" group. Proletarian revolutionaries—supporters of Marx's teachings who believed that the leading role in the revolutionary movement should belong to the proletariat—emerged in Russia at that time.
      One such revolutionary was Georgy Valentinovich Plekhanov
     
      (1856–1918) , the first propagandist of Marxism in Russia.
     
      After leaving the country, Plekhanov formed the revolutionary Marxist group "Emancipation of Labor" in 1883. The group translated the works of Marx and Engels into Russian and disseminated them in Russia. It also pointed out the enormous harm the Narodnik teachings and their methods of struggle wrought on the workers' movement.
      Study circles in which Marx's works were studied began to develop rapidly in Russia. However, both the "Emancipation of Labor" group and these circles were not yet connected to the workers' movement.
      This was done by Lenin, who organized the Bolshevik Party and led the working class and peasantry in struggle against the tsarist government, landowners, and the bourgeoisie.
     
      Lenin at school.
     
      V. I. Lenin—leader of the working class and founder of Bolshevism. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (Ulyanov) was born in 1870 in the city of Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk). He was an excellent student at school. At 17, Lenin enrolled at Kazan University, but was soon expelled for participating in the revolutionary student movement. He then began preparing for the university's full curriculum exams, which he passed.
      In Kazan, Lenin joined a Marxist circle, studied the works of Marx and Engels, and amazed everyone with his knowledge.
      In 1893, Lenin moved to St. Petersburg and began working with workers in circles.
      Lenin united all the workers' circles in St. Petersburg into the "Union of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class," thereby paving the way for the creation of a truly revolutionary workers' party. At his suggestion, similar unions were organized in other cities.

      Vladimir Ilyich Lenin in the 1890s.
     
      Lenin mercilessly fought the Narodniks and all those who misinterpreted Marx's teachings.
      Lenin delved into every detail of workers' lives, writing leaflets and books for them, calling for a persistent struggle against the capitalists.
      Tsarist detectives managed to arrest Lenin. He was held in prison for a long time, and then exiled to Siberia for three years.
      The "Leagues of Struggle" organized by Lenin made the first attempt to unite into a party. For this purpose, the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was convened in Minsk in 1898. However, the party failed to form at this congress.
      After returning from exile, Lenin went abroad and began publishing the first Marxist newspaper, called Iskra.
      Iskra was printed on thin tissue paper to facilitate its clandestine smuggling back to Russia.
      Lenin wrote articles for Iskra, calling on workers to unite in a revolutionary political party to fight the autocracy and the capitalists.
      Lenin's Iskra prepared the way for the creation of the Bolshevik Party.
      The workers' struggle flared up and soon spread to the outskirts of Russia, including Transcaucasia, where Lenin's disciple, Comrade Stalin, had been working since the late 1990s.
     
      X. The First Bourgeois Revolution in Russia
     
      45. On the Eve of the Revolution:
     
      the Obukhov Defense and the Rostov Strike. From the beginning of the 20th century, the revolutionary workers' struggle intensified. Workers staged strikes, demonstrated, and rose up to fight against the capitalists and the tsarist government.
      Nicholas II was the tsar at the time. (He began his reign in 1894.)
      In 1901, in St. Petersburg, on May Day (a holiday celebrated by workers around the world), workers at the Obukhov military plant went on strike. They presented their demands to their management. The confused administration didn't know what to do and asked the workers: "So, what's wrong? You'll soon demand that not only us, but also the ministers be fired?" "Not only the ministers, but the tsar himself," the strikers responded.
      Factory management called in the police and troops to suppress the workers. But the strikers erected barricades in and around the factory and met the arriving pacifiers with a hail of stones and broken iron. Police and soldiers opened fire. For several hours, the workers fought the troops.
     
      The strikers were dispersed.
     
      Several workers were killed and seriously wounded. This workers' struggle became known as the Obukhov Defense. About 800 participants in the defense were arrested, many of them imprisoned for long periods and exiled to hard labor.
      News of the Obukhov heroes spread throughout the country. Workers rose up in all corners of vast Russia.
      In 1902, a large railway workers' strike occurred in the city of Rostov-on-Don. They were joined by workers from other factories. The strike and workers' meetings were led by the RSDLP committee. Committee members spoke openly at meetings, calling on workers to wage a decisive and steadfast struggle until complete victory over the tsarist regime. Workers' rallies outside the city lasted for several days. Up to 30,000 workers from Rostov-on-Don attended these meetings. The police and local Rostov troops were powerless to stop the strikers.
      Rostov authorities, in an attempt to suppress the strike, called in Cossacks from neighboring towns. Only then was the strike called off.
      The Rostov strike demonstrated that the Russian working class had risen to open political struggle against the tsarist regime.
      The peasant movement. Following the workers, the peasants also rose up. In the spring and summer of 1902, the peasant struggle spread to more than 300 villages and hamlets in Ukraine and the Volga region. Peasants destroyed landowners' estates, divided the landowners' grain among the hungry, and seized the landowners' lands.
      Troops were sent against the peasants. They were shot and flogged to death with rods. Thousands of peasants were arrested and imprisoned. The peasant movement was crushed. The peasants did not yet understand that to defeat the landowners, they first had to destroy the tsarist regime.
      Lenin, in the newspaper Iskra, called on the peasants to fight against the tsarist regime together with the workers. But the work of the Social Democrats, supporters of Iskra, in the villages was hampered by the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRs), which arose at the beginning of the 20th century. This party, under the guise of protecting the peasants, defended the interests of the kulaks and tried to implement the incorrect program of the Narodniks.
      Lenin waged a persistent struggle against the SRs.
      The Russian Social Democratic Labor Party was founded. Lenin's Iskra rallied the disparate Social Democratic organizations in Russia. What had previously failed—to create a revolutionary proletarian party—was now achieved.
      In 1903, the Second Congress of the RSDLP convened secretly abroad. Forty-three delegates from various Russian cities attended the congress. The congress adopted the party program, developed by V. I. Lenin. It outlined the primary task of the working-class party—organizing a socialist revolution, establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieving the victory of socialism. But to achieve this primary goal, the program stated that the party must first achieve its immediate objective—overthrowing the tsarist autocracy in Russia, creating a democratic republic, establishing an eight-hour workday for workers, abolishing all remnants of serfdom in the countryside, and reclaiming the peasants' land.
      To achieve these great goals, Lenin demanded that only staunch fighters for the workers' cause, proven friends of the working class, be admitted to the party. The party, Lenin argued, must be the vanguard of the working class, and its members must be selflessly devoted to the revolution. Lenin demanded that party membership be restricted to those who accepted the party's program and participated personally in one of its organizations. Martov, Trotsky, and several other delegates opposed this demand. They proposed admitting anyone who wished to join the party, including anyone who promised to contribute to the party in any way, but did not require mandatory work in its organizations or submission to party discipline. Such a proposal weakened the party as the leader of the working class, as it could be infiltrated by unstable, hostile bourgeois elements.
      Following this, Lenin's opponents, led by Martov and Trotsky, proposed that the workers form an alliance with the bourgeoisie, not the toiling peasantry, to fight tsarism. Lenin denounced the harm of Martov and Trotsky's proposals and argued that the working class should never enter into an agreement with the bourgeoisie, lest it betray the workers. The workers needed to unite not with the bourgeoisie, but with the revolutionary peasantry, and join forces to fight against the tsar and the landowners. Lenin and his supporters advocated immediately beginning the struggle against the capitalists, the struggle for socialism, after the overthrow of tsarism and the landowners.
      The congress elected the Central Committee of the party and the editorial board of the newspaper Iskra, which it tasked with directing the party's work. Lenin's supporters were elected to the Central Committee and the editorial board of Iskra; they received a majority of votes at the congress, earning them the nickname "Bolsheviks," while his opponents, who received a minority at the congress, were called "Mensheviks." After the congress, the majority of Russian Social Democratic organizations supported the Bolsheviks.
      Comrade Stalin was not present at the Second Congress; he was in prison. In 1904, he escaped from Siberian exile and led the workers of Transcaucasia to the Bolsheviks.
      Advanced workers firmly believed in Lenin and Stalin. There were thousands of such workers at the time.
      Under the leadership of the RSDLP, the first general workers' strikes occurred in the summer of 1903 in the major cities of Ukraine and the Caucasus. All factories and plants came to a standstill. Workers gathered in the thousands on the streets and squares. Speakers delivered speeches about the revolution. Workers staged marches and demonstrations with red flags—the banners of the proletarian struggle for socialism. Having amassed troops in the cities, the tsarist government suppressed these strikes.
      But the strikes had their effect—they accelerated and brought the revolution closer.
     
      46. The Revolution Began
     
      . War with Japan. Tsar Nicholas II tried by all means to stifle the revolution. Those close to the Tsar advised him to quickly begin the long-planned war with Japan. They believed that war would delay the revolution. "Better war than revolution," his courtiers advised Nicholas II.
      But the Japanese started the war first. In January 1904, without any declaration of war, they treacherously attacked the Russian-built fortress on the Yellow Sea, Port Arthur, where Russian warships were moored, and blew up the best of them with mines.
      Japan transported troops from its islands by sea to Manchuria. The well-armed and trained Japanese army began to defeat the backward Tsarist army, poorly armed and led by incompetent generals—bribe-takers and thieves.
      The Japanese captured the fortress of Port Arthur and defeated the Tsarist army at Mukden. In the narrow Tsushima Strait, the Japanese destroyed the last warships of Tsarist Russia sent from the Baltic Sea.
      The tsarist autocracy, defeated in the war, concluded a shameful peace with Japan. Japan took half of Sakhalin Island and Port Arthur from Russia, and entrenched itself in Korea.
      Bloody Sunday and the first Soviet of Workers' Deputies. The unsuccessful Russo-Japanese War further intensified the people's hatred of the tsarist government. The war did not delay the revolution, but rather accelerated it.
      In early January 1905, the large Putilov factory (now the Kirov factory) in St. Petersburg went on strike.
      A general strike soon broke out in St. Petersburg. Stormy meetings and assemblies took place at the factories. The workers sought a way out of their dire and disenfranchised situation. They put forward demands for an eight-hour workday, freedom of association, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. The workers also demanded the transfer of landed estates to the peasants and the convening of a Constituent Assembly to change the political system in Russia.
      To combat the labor movement, several months before the strike, the tsarist government created the "Workers' Society," headed by the provocateur priest Gapon. When the strike began, Gapon urged workers at his society's meetings to march to the tsar and write him a petition. The workers included all their demands in this petition. The Bolsheviks urged the workers not to listen to Gapon. "Freedom and land are not won by petitioning the tsar," they said, "they must be won with arms in hand." But Gapon convinced the workers to go to the tsar with this petition. Gapon had a hidden agenda: to provoke bloodshed among the workers and thereby weaken the labor movement.
      On January 9, 1905, early on a frosty morning, crowds of workers with their wives and children marched to the Winter Palace. In total, over 140,000 people gathered.
      The unarmed populace greeted the tsar's troops with volleys of gunfire. More than a thousand people were killed, hacked to death with sabers, or crushed to death by Cossack horses. The streets of St. Petersburg were awash with workers' blood.
     
      On January 9, 1905, hundreds of workers were shot in the square near the Winter Palace.
     
      That day, the workers learned a bloody lesson. It became clear to everyone that the tsar and his servants could not be trusted. That evening, workers began building barricades on the outskirts of the city. Red flags flew from the barricades. Workers attacked officers and police officers, disarming them. The Bolsheviks led the workers' struggle.
      An explosion of indignation at the tsar's bloody atrocity swept across the country. Workers abandoned their jobs and took to the streets singing revolutionary songs, chanting the slogan "Down with the Tsarist Autocracy." Revolution soon engulfed the entire country.
      Mass strikes and worker protests continued throughout the spring.
      In May 1905, a particularly stubborn strike began in the textile mill town of Ivanovo-Voznesensk. The workers were led by Bolsheviks.
      Outside the city, thousands of workers gathered on the Talka River. They elected deputies to lead their struggle against the tsarist regime and the factory owners, forming a Council.
      This was one of the first Soviets of Workers' Deputies in Russia. This Council met daily, surrounded by thousands of workers. Bolsheviks, who led the Council, spoke at these meetings. The crowd listened eagerly to the revolutionary speeches of the orators. The heroic struggle of the workers lasted for more than two months. The workers and their families were starving, but they did not surrender. But on orders from the tsarist governor, troops began firing on the workers. Finally, the workers' strength was exhausted. On the proposal of the Council, a 40,000-strong meeting of workers decided to end the strike. The strike steeled the workers and prepared them for a further, even more stubborn struggle.
      Peasant Movement. In the spring of 1905, peasant unrest began. In central Russia and the Volga region, peasants seized land and forests, stole grain from landowners' barns, and divided it among the hungry. They burned landowners' estates, demanded division, and in some places seized the landowners' lands. Frightened landowners fled their estates under the protection of troops and police. The tsarist government sent soldiers and Cossacks against the peasants. Troops shot, imprisoned, and flogged peasants. But the peasants, supported by workers in the cities, did not cease their struggle. The peasant movement grew stronger every day.
     
      Peasants seized landowners' estates.
     
      In Georgia, peasants stopped paying their dues to the landowners. In several places, they seized land, pastures, and forests, refusing to recognize any tsarist authority. The peasants themselves managed affairs.
      In Latvia and Estonia, farm laborers rebelled in the spring and summer of 1905. They armed themselves and formed revolutionary peasant committees. Relying on these organizations, they expelled the German barons, landowners, from the villages of Latvia and Estonia.
      Peasants in Ukraine and Belarus also rose up in struggle against the tsarist government and the landowners.
      The Third Congress of the RSDLP. At Lenin's insistence, the Third Congress of the RSDLP was convened in London in April 1905. The party then had up to 8,500 members. Delegates from 20 Bolshevik party committees attended the congress. The Mensheviks refused to participate in the congress and did not attend.
      Lenin stated at the congress that for the revolution to succeed, it was necessary to create and strengthen an alliance of workers and peasants, join forces to launch an armed uprising, overthrow the tsar, and establish a revolutionary government of workers and peasants. The peasants must create their own revolutionary committees and seize all the land from the landowners without compensation. The workers must lead and support this peasant struggle.
      Lenin further stated that after the overthrow of the tsar and the landowners, the Bolsheviks must lead the workers and poorest peasants in a struggle against the capitalists and kulaks, in a struggle for socialist revolution.
      The Third Congress accepted all of Lenin's proposals.
      The delegates returned to Russia and began implementing the congress's decisions with great energy.
      At the same time, Stalin, who was working in Transcaucasia, was leading the struggle for the victory of the revolution alongside Lenin. Stalin strengthened Bolshevik committees there, prepared for the Bolshevik Congress, created an underground printing press, wrote leaflets for the workers, taught and rallied revolutionary workers and peasants, and directed preparations for an armed uprising. Comrade Stalin devoted much effort to uniting the workers and toiling peoples of Transcaucasia and all of Russia into a single family.
     
      47. Preparation for an Armed Uprising.
     
      Mutiny on the battleship Potemkin. The revolution spread to the army. In June 1905, a sailor's revolt broke out on the battleship Potemkin in the Black Sea.
     
      The revolt took place in June 1905.
     
      The battleship was anchored near Odessa, where workers were on strike. The sailors knew about the events in Odessa and were extremely excited, eager to join the fight to support the workers, who were urging them to fight.
      One day during lunch, one of the sailors shouted,
      "Guys, there are worms in the borscht!"
      The ship's officers were feeding the sailors rotten meat and pocketing the money.
      This incident with the worms in the borscht precipitated the uprising. A murmur arose among the sailors. The ship's commander appeared and ordered the sailors to disperse. The sailors disobeyed. The commander ordered 30 sailors arrested and executed. The sailors' hearts boiled with anger and resentment. At the call of sailor Matyushenko, they armed themselves and, shouting "Beat the monsters!", rushed at the hated officers, killed them, and threw them overboard.
      A red flag was raised over the Potemkin.
      The Tsar sent warships to suppress the Potemkin. But the sailors on these ships refused to fire on the rebellious battleship. The Potemkin, however, could not hold out for long without coal and provisions. Nor did it have sufficiently experienced Bolshevik leaders.
      The Potemkin crew was forced to flee to Romania and surrender to the authorities there.
      Despite the failure of the uprising on the Potemkin, it inspired the workers. They saw the navy and army beginning to defect to the revolution.
      The October General Strike. By the autumn of 1905, the revolutionary movement had engulfed the entire country. With each passing day, the ranks of the strikers swelled with workers from new factories and plants. Workers held meetings in the streets and often clashed with the police and troops who dispersed them.
      In early October, a strike broke out on the Moscow railways, soon spreading to railways across the country. Postal and telegraph services ceased operation.
      Teachers, doctors, professors, and students joined the workers in the struggle. In Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav (now Dnepropetrovsk), workers began building barricades and, after sacking weapons stores, engaged in gunfights with troops and police.
      Under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, workers' unions (trade unions) were organized in many cities. In major industrial centers, Soviets of Workers' Deputies were established. These were the seeds of a new, revolutionary power of workers and peasants. Many Soviets of Workers' Deputies prepared for an uprising, procuring weapons by various means and training workers in military affairs. Combat squads were formed in almost all large factories and plants where Bolshevik party organizations were present. The tsarist government ordered the troops to "spare no ammunition" and to mercilessly execute strikers.
      In a number of cities, troops fired on workers and dispersed assemblies. The workers were still unable to launch an armed uprising. There were very few combat squads and a shortage of weapons. But even the tsar lacked the strength to suppress the revolutionary movement. His troops were in a state of severe unrest: soldiers began to openly sympathize with the revolution. This was facilitated by the work of the Bolsheviks in the army, where they secretly distributed leaflets calling on soldiers to join the revolution. The tsar's defeat in the war with Japan also contributed to this.
      Frightened by the spread of the revolution, Tsar Nicholas II issued a manifesto on October 17. In it, he promised to grant freedom to the people and convene a State Duma of representatives of the population to decide, together with the tsar, all state affairs of Russia. The October 17 manifesto was a blatant deception. The tsarist government needed to buy time to gather its forces and drown the revolution in blood. Despite the manifesto of freedoms, the police continued to disperse assemblies, arresting and killing workers and their Bolshevik leaders. In Moscow, tsarist pogromists assassinated Nikolai Ernestovich Bauman, a remarkable Bolshevik leader of the Moscow workers. At Bauman's funeral, a hundred thousand Moscow workers, led by the Moscow Committee of the Bolshevik Party, followed his coffin.
      In November 1905, Lenin arrived from abroad. He directed the work of the party and the workers' struggle.
      Meanwhile, in Transcaucasia, Stalin, just as firmly, in Lenin's style, prepared the workers for battle against the tsar and his servants. He denounced the Mensheviks, who opposed preparations for an armed uprising. Comrade Stalin told the workers of Tbilisi: "What is needed to truly win? Three things are needed, understand and remember: the first thing we need is arms; the second is arms; the third is more and more arms."
      In December 1905, the question of an armed uprising was discussed at a Bolshevik conference.
      Here, Lenin and Stalin met in person for the first time. Before that, they had kept in touch by letter and through comrades.
     
      48. The December Armed Uprising.
     
      An armed uprising of Moscow workers. On December 7, 1905, a general strike began in Moscow, quickly escalating into an armed uprising. At a predetermined hour set by the Bolsheviks, factories, plants, and railways stopped operating, and the electricity went out. Newspapers ceased publication. Workers began to arm themselves, and militias grew. Police and troops broke up workers' meetings, firing into houses where militias were gathering. Workers on Bronnaya, Tverskaya (now Gorky Street), at the train stations, and at the Goujon factory (now the Hammer and Sickle factory) began to build barricades. Soon, many Moscow streets were covered with barricades made of carts, tram cars, barrels, crates, and street lamps. All this was dumped in the middle of the street, wrapped in telegraph and tram wires. The tsarist cavalry and mounted police could not move through these barriers. At many barricades, workers' combat squads, armed with revolvers, fired at the troops. A continuous firefight raged on the streets of Moscow for several dien. Soybean squads from other places rushed to Moscow's aid. The brave Bolshevik M.V. Frunze arrived from Ivanovo-Voznesensk with his combat workers' squad.
      Peasants brought bread and potatoes to the workers in Moscow, and sometimes joined the ranks of fighters at the barricades. Presnya (a working-class district of Moscow) became the center of the struggle. The Bolsheviks led the squads. Under their leadership, Presnya held out against the tsarist troops for 10 days. It was a proletarian fortress, where power belonged to the rebellious workers. The Presnya workers heroically defended their district. The workers were assisted by their wives. They bandaged and fed the wounded. The youth demonstrated tremendous courage. They scouted, helped build barricades and ambushes, and fought against the troops.

      Workers on the Kazan Railway also fought stubbornly against the tsarist troops.
      There weren't enough troops to counter the rebellious people in Moscow. The tsar sent two regiments of soldiers to Moscow. Only with the help of cannons and machine guns were the rebels routed. General Dubasov sacked Moscow. On December 18, the fighting squads were forced to abandon the barricades and hide their weapons in secret caches. More than a thousand people were killed in Moscow. Fires caused by artillery shells raged for several days throughout the city. The bodies of murdered workers, women, and children littered the streets. Many revolutionary fighters were shot and hanged by the tsarist troops.
      This is how the tsar's executioners dealt with the rebellious Moscow.
      During the armed uprising, Lenin was in St. Petersburg. The Bolshevik Central Committee took every measure to rouse the workers to revolt in St. Petersburg. However, the Mensheviks, led by Trotsky, who had established themselves in the St. Petersburg Soviet, opposed supporting the armed uprising in Moscow. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries thwarted the workers' revolution. They supported the bourgeoisie, which had conspired with the tsarist government to suppress the revolution. The strike that began in St. Petersburg in December ended without sparking an armed uprising.
      The struggle of peasants against landlords. During the revolution, peasants rose up against their landlord oppressors throughout almost all of Russia, under the influence of the workers' movement and the appeals of the Bolshevik Party. Almost all of Russia's provinces were engulfed in a peasant movement. Over 7,000 peasant revolutionary uprisings occurred during the three years of revolutionary struggle. Peasants seized land from landowners and monasteries, cut down landowners' and monastery forests, and raided and burned landowners' estates everywhere. In the Saratov province alone, in the fall and winter of 1905, peasants destroyed up to 300 landowners' estates. Peasants expelled the police, volost elders, and village elders and established their own elected government. The most progressive peasants united in peasant unions. The Bolsheviks assisted them in this. The tsar and landowners sent punitive detachments and suppressed peasant uprisings.
      Armed uprisings of the oppressed peoples of Russia. In Transcaucasia, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, workers and peasants bravely fought the tsarist troops. All of Georgia was engulfed in rebellion. Masses of tsarist troops were sent into Georgia. Georgian workers and peasants repeatedly engaged in battle with them.
      In December 1905, many towns and villages in Georgia burned like bonfires lit by tsarist troops.
      In Ukraine, the first outbreaks of armed rebellion began during the October general strike. The largest uprising in December 1905 occurred in the Donbass: in Horlivka and Luhansk. Factory workers and miners fought for several days against tsarist troops. The workers in Luhansk were then led by the mechanic Klim Voroshilov.
      In Finland, workers formed their own armed Red Guard. The Red Guard disarmed the tsarist police. Gendarmes, police officers, and tsarist officials abandoned their service in Finland and fled to Russia.
      The Finnish people elected their own government. The Finnish bourgeoisie, frightened by the growing revolutionary workers' movement, came to an agreement with the tsar and betrayed the workers. The labor movement was soon brutally suppressed. The Red Guard was destroyed, and the government was dispersed.
      Oppressed peoples everywhere fought against the hated tsarist government. But the bourgeoisie of these peoples, like the Russian bourgeoisie, fought the revolution in alliance with the tsarist regime.
      This time, the workers and peasants were forced to retreat. The tsar, the landowners, and the bourgeoisie proved stronger. The blood of workers and peasants of all the peoples of Russia spilled in the revolution united the workers and united them in a close, great alliance for a new struggle.
      The 1905 revolution resonated throughout the world. It was the most powerful struggle of the proletariat since the Paris Commune of 1871.
      Under the influence of the Russian revolution, a mass strike movement began in Western Europe. In Turkey, workers overthrew their sultan, in Iran, the shah, and in China, the emperor. A republic was established in China.
     
      49. Defeat of the revolution
     
      Suppression of revolutionary uprisings. Despite the bloody reprisals against the rebellious people, the revolution continued. In 1906, workers' strikes, peasants, soldiers, and sailors continued. Particularly significant were the sailors' uprisings in July-August 1906 in Kronstadt and Sveaborg. Thousands of sailors rose up in rebellion, slaughtered their officers, and established their rule in isolated fortifications. But the sailors were poorly organized, and tsarist officers succeeded in suppressing the uprising. The government arrested more than 4,000 sailors.
      Tsarist Minister Stolypin issued a law for the merciless extermination of revolutionaries. From 1906 to 1909, under this law, more than 2,000 people were hanged, and 25,000 were sent to hard labor, exiled, and imprisoned. Tens of thousands of revolutionaries were shot and tortured without trial. The arrested revolutionaries were subjected to every kind of cruelty: they were tortured in dungeons, had needles driven under their fingernails, burned with hot irons, and starved. Stolypin was particularly harsh against the Bolsheviks. Thousands of revolutionaries devoted to the workers' cause perished on the gallows and in hard labor.
      Many Bolshevik party organizations were destroyed, the Soviets of Workers' Deputies were destroyed, trade unions and all peasant organizations were closed.
     
      Exiled parties were driven one after another to Siberia.
     
      State Duma. In the same spirit of suppressing the revolutionary movement, Nicholas II convened the State Duma in 1906. According to the law on Duma elections, landowners and capitalists had the right to send more deputies than tens of millions of workers and peasants. Women were deprived of the right to vote. Such was the tsarist constitution.
      But the tsar soon violated this constitution, too. The first and second State Dumas convened by the tsar were dissolved by him, as they were not always obedient to the tsar and his ministers. The tsar was especially displeased with the Second Duma. Many representatives of peasants and workers were elected to it. Social Democrats had 65 deputies. In their speeches in the Duma, workers and peasants denounced the tsarist government, all its tricks and deceptions of the people. The Tsar ordered the Duma to be dispersed.
      Tsarist officials drafted a new law on Duma elections. The rights of workers and peasants were further curtailed. All peoples of Siberia and Central Asia were disenfranchised, while the rights of the peoples of the Caucasus and Poland were curtailed. And when the Third Duma convened in the autumn of 1907, the seats in the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg, where the Duma sessions were held, were almost entirely filled with landowners, merchants, factory owners, generals, and tsarist dignitaries in gilded uniforms.
      Only a few seats were occupied by deputies representing workers, peasants, and the oppressed peoples of Russia.
      The State Duma did not change the old order. The nobility, led by the Tsar, continued to rule and plunder Russia.
      The Third Duma approved the land law of the Tsarist minister Stolypin. All the lands of the landowners remained theirs. The peasants were to be content with the land they had previously owned, but only under new conditions. Previously, most peasants owned the land communally and periodically divided these communal lands among themselves based on the number of workers in their families. Stolypin's law abolished communal land ownership. Each peasant was offered the opportunity to take his plot of land into personal ownership, separate from the commune, and become the owner of his own plot. These peasants who separated from the commune were called khutoryans (farmers), or otrubniks (unclear peasants).
      Poor peasants, lacking draft animals, tools, or money to pay taxes, sold their plots to wealthy kulaks (kulaks). This was precisely what the tsarist government sought. It wanted to turn the kulaks into small landowners who would defend the tsar's power.
      More than a million poor peasants were completely deprived of their land and ruined. The government resettled dissatisfied peasants to the lands of peoples living on the outskirts of Russia. The local population was forcibly driven from their native lands into the deserts and mountains.
      The country's economy after the revolution. Foreign capitalists also helped the tsarist government suppress the revolution. Even before the revolution, they had been purchasing land in Russia with ore, oil, and coal deposits and building their own factories and plants. French and English bankers lent the tsarist government large sums of money, which was used to build railways, finance the army, and support tsarist officials. The revolution in Russia threatened foreign capitalists with the loss of their capital and the enormous profits they earned in Russia.
     
      A metallurgical plant.
     
      Even before the revolution in Russia, capitalists began to form unions to raise prices and deal more quickly with workers. Such associations of capitalists were called trusts and syndicates. After the revolution, bourgeois trusts and syndicates grew in number.
      After several years of stagnation, industry in Russia revived in 1910: coal, metal, and oil production increased, while sugar and textile production also expanded. Grain exports also increased significantly.
      While Russia made significant economic progress at this time, it remained a backward country compared to Western Europe and dependent on foreign capitalists. Machines and machine tools were not produced in Russia—they were imported from abroad—and there was no chemical industry. Russia did not produce mineral fertilizers. Russia also lagged behind other capitalist countries in arms production.
      It turns out that there were more than a few reasons for the defeat of the first bourgeois revolution in Russia. Chief among them was the lack of an alliance between workers and peasants. While the peasants felt that a successful struggle against the landlords was impossible without an alliance with the workers, they failed to understand that the landlords could not be defeated without the overthrow of tsarism. The peasants still believed in the goodwill of their "father the tsar." This is why many peasants were reluctant to form an alliance with the workers to overthrow tsarism, while the sons of peasants, disguised in soldiers' greatcoats, helped the tsar suppress strikes and workers' uprisings. The peasants trusted the compromising Socialist Revolutionaries more than the Bolshevik revolutionaries.
      The workers also had their shortcomings. The working class was, of course, the vanguard of the revolution, but it was not yet united and cohesive, as its party, the Social Democracy, was divided into two groups: the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. The former were compromising and did not want to see the revolution through to completion. The latter, the Bolsheviks, were consistent Leninist revolutionaries and called on the workers to overthrow tsarism. This is why the workers did not always act in unison in the revolution, and the working class was unable to become the true leader (hegemon) of the revolution.
      The hastily concluded peace with Japan also helped the tsar suppress the revolution. While the war raged and the tsarist troops suffered defeat, the tsar remained weak and was forced to yield to the workers' onslaught. After the conclusion of peace, the situation changed, and the tsar was able to gather forces to fight the revolution.
     
      50. A New Revolutionary Upsurge:
     
      Lenin's departure abroad. Stalin engaged in underground work in Russia. Despite numerous arrests and executions, the Bolsheviks continued the revolutionary struggle. They printed leaflets, newspapers, and brochures. The Bolsheviks used the State Duma election meetings and the Duma itself to openly declare their revolutionary demands and the masses' hatred of the existing system.
      The entire tsarist police force was deployed to capture the elusive Lenin. At the insistence of the Party, Vladimir Ilyich left first for Finland and then abroad, to Switzerland. From there, he continued to lead the workers' struggle.
      Lenin's comrade and assistant, Comrade Stalin, remained in Russia. His seething energy inspired the Bolsheviks to a difficult and persistent struggle. In 1908, Stalin was arrested again and exiled to a Siberian province. But prison and exile could not break Stalin's iron will, and the following year, Stalin escaped Siberia and returned to Baku. A year passed. Stalin was arrested again and exiled again. He escaped again. Soon, tsarist spies tracked him down again, and the government exiled Stalin to the deserted Narym region. But the steadfast revolutionary did not give up. In the summer of 1912, he secretly returned to St. Petersburg.
      Lenin abroad, and Stalin underground in Russia, continued the great struggle for socialism, ready to give their blood drop by drop for the workers' cause.
      The heroic Bolsheviks helped the working class survive the difficult times of the revolution's defeat and rise again to the revolutionary struggle.
      The Lena massacre of workers. In the remote Siberian taiga, on the Lena River, lay the gold mines of British capitalists. The lives of the workers there were little different from those of convicts. The British capitalists, however, reaped a profit of 7 million rubles in gold a year from these mines.
      In the spring of 1912, the workers at the Lena gold mines went on strike.
      At the British request, the tsarist government sent a detachment of troops under the command of a gendarme officer to the mines. He immediately arrested all the workers' leaders, including exiled Bolsheviks. The workers demanded the release of those arrested. They went to the office. The workers walked along a narrow path, several abreast. Suddenly, a bugle sounded. At the gendarme officer's command, the soldiers lined up along the road. The command to shoot was given.
     
      The execution of workers at the Lena gold mines on April 4, 1912.
     
      Shots rang out. And again and again, the soldiers fired at the workers. Two hundred and fifty dead and 270 wounded workers lay in pools of blood in the snow.
      News of the massacre on the Lena River spread throughout Russia. Hundreds of thousands of workers abandoned their jobs and took to the streets to protest the new massacre.
      On May 1, 1912, half a million workers went on strike in Russia. In the villages, peasants once again took up axes, scythes, and pitchforks and destroyed the landowners' estates. Over 13,000 revolutionary peasant uprisings occurred between 1910 and 1914.
      The Russian people were rising up for a new struggle and marching toward a new revolution.
      The Bolsheviks were an independent Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. In 1912, representatives of the Russian Bolshevik committees met abroad, in Prague, for a conference. The conference resolved to expel all Mensheviks and all unstable and wavering elements from the party.
      A united, militant Leninist Bolshevik Party was created. It led the working class and peasantry to a new resolution calling for the overthrow of the tsarist regime and the establishment of workers' and peasants' power, the establishment of an eight-hour workday, and the free transfer of all land to the peasants.
      The Bolsheviks strengthened their secret party organizations in Russia, including trade unions, workers' clubs, and other open workers' organizations under Bolshevik leadership.
      Bolshevik newspapers, Zvezda, and then Pravda, began to be published in St. Petersburg. The Bolshevik Pravda was written in simple language understandable to all workers. It helped workers understand the teachings of the Bolshevik Party. The police relentlessly harassed this newspaper, forbidding its sale, and imprisoning editors. V. I. Lenin wrote articles for Pravda and managed it from abroad. I. V. Stalin, V. M. Molotov, and others worked for Pravda.
     
      Barricades in St. Petersburg in July 1914.
     
      During this time, the party nurtured many strong and courageous Bolshevik revolutionaries. Among them was Yakov Sverdlov. He began his revolutionary struggle at the age of seventeen. After spending many years in prison and exile, from which he escaped several times, he finally reached St. Petersburg and fearlessly led the fight against tsarism. S. M. Kirov began his revolutionary activities as early as 1905 and never stopped. Only prisons and exile temporarily distracted this fiery revolutionary from his work. M. V. Frunze, G. K. Ordzhonikidze, V. V. Kuibyshev, and F. E. Dzerzhinsky were all courageous fighters for the workers' cause. M. I. Kalinin, K. E. Voroshilov, L. M. Kaganovich, N. K. Krupskaya, and many others worked tirelessly within the party. They were the party's iron guard, the tireless and steadfast disciples and comrades of Lenin and Stalin.
      Lenin moved from Paris, where he lived, to Austria, closer to the Russian border, to better direct the work of the Bolsheviks in Russia.
      At this time, strikes were breaking out one after another in Russia. In Baku, where Stalin had created a strong Bolshevik organization, workers declared a general strike in the oil fields. The workers fought for about a month, but the factory owners prevailed.
      In the summer of 1914, the workers of St. Petersburg again stopped factories and plants. They took to the streets with red banners. The workers responded to the attack by troops and police with resistance on the barricades.
      But the rise of the revolution was delayed by the outbreak of the world war. In this war, the tsarist government again sought salvation or revolution.
     
      XI. The Second Bourgeois Revolution in Russia
     
      51. The World Imperialist War
     
      Tsarist Russia at war. In the summer of 1914, the world war began. This war had been in the works for some time. The major capitalist states competed with one another. By the beginning of the 20th century, there wasn't a single inch of land on the globe that hadn't been seized by some state. Capitalists from various countries sought to seize rich lands with numerous populations from each other. German capitalists and landowners were especially greedy in their desire to seize lands. Germany sought to seize some of England's African colonies, and Russia's Ukraine, Poland, and the Baltic states; Russia sought to seize Constantinople from Turkey; England, Mesopotamia and Palestine; France sought to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine, occupied by Germany. In preparation for this predatory war, the capitalists were divided into two camps. In one camp were England, France, and Russia, dependent on them. Their alliance was called the Entente. In the other camp were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria. Almost all European countries supported the Entente. Japan and the United States of America were allied with them.
      The bourgeoisie of the warring countries prepared this predatory war in secret from the people. First, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, then Germany, long preparing for war, declared war on Russia. After that, other countries entered the war. When the war began, the bourgeoisie of all the belligerent countries deceived the people, declaring it a war to save their homeland from the enemy. The petty-bourgeois conciliatory parties—the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries—assisted the Russian bourgeoisie in deceiving the people.
      The world war lasted four years and cost humanity approximately 30 million lives. The greatest losses were in the army of Tsarist Russia.
      While the Germans showered the Russian army with shells, the Tsar's ministers and generals left it without sufficient weapons and ammunition.
      Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers died daily from German cannon fire, machine guns, and disease. But the tsarist generals, obedient to the orders of Tsar Nicholas II and the Entente, urged their soldiers onward with renewed vigor. The generals paid no heed to casualties; for them, soldiers were mere cannon fodder. In the very first months, on the battlefields of Germany, the incompetent tsarist generals destroyed an entire army of 200,000 men. Russia continually recruited new soldiers. At first, only young men were recruited, but later, older men were also included. In total, up to 19 million men were recruited for the war in Russia.
      During the war, the Russian army inflicted several crushing defeats on the Austro-German armies. The Russian offensive on the Southwestern Front in the summer of 1916 was particularly successful.
      The Russian army captured enormous trophies and over 100,000 prisoners. This victory forced the Germans to transfer a large number of troops from the Western Front to the Eastern Russian Front and thus helped Italy, France and England stop the German offensive on the Western Front.
      However, the remarkable breakthrough of the Southwestern Front was not supported by other Russian armies. The incompetent high command and the tsarist government failed to arm or supply the army with everything it needed. At the tsarist court, in the ministries, and throughout the army, there were German spies who passed military secrets to the Germans. Bleeding, dying from gas attacks, freezing in the trenches, the tsarist army, led by incompetent generals, was forced to retreat. By 1916, the Germans had captured Poland, Lithuania, and part of Latvia. But there was no end in sight to the war.
      The war had severely devastated the Russian economy. There were shortages of metal, coal, and oil. Factories were shut down. The railways couldn't even transport troops. The army and the people were naked and barefoot. The population and soldiers at the front were starving. The grain crops dwindled—there was no one to till the land. A large number of horses and cattle were taken from the peasants for the army. The protracted war imposed incredible pressure on the workers and peasants.
      The Bolsheviks during the war. The Bolshevik Party opposed global slaughter. Lenin and the Party called on the workers and peasants to take up arms against their oppressors and exposed the vileness of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries and their capitalist overlords.
      In the very first days of the war, workers' organizations were destroyed and closed. The Bolshevik newspaper Pravda was banned even before the declaration of war. Bolshevik deputies of the Fourth State Duma were exiled to Siberia for calling for an anti-war campaign and for calling workers to revolution.
      The work of the Bolsheviks during the war was difficult. Lenin was separated from Russia by borders and fronts. Other leaders of the Bolshevik Party were in exile. Many Bolsheviks were imprisoned.
      But the work of the Bolsheviks did not cease.
      The revolutionary movement during the war. In Russia, under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, mass strikes began.
      In 1915, there were already 928 strikes in Russia, and in January and February 1917, 1,330. Workers continued their struggle under the slogan: "Down with the war! Down with the tsarist autocracy!" The
      workers of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> (as St. Petersburg was called from 1914 to 1924) fought at the forefront. In October 1916, they organized a huge political strike against the war and the tsarist autocracy. They even attracted a regiment of soldiers to their side.
      The workers were also supported by peasants, who rose up in the villages to fight against the war, the landowners, and Stolypin's land laws.
     
      A Russian soldier, standing among barbed wire, curses the tsarist government.
     
      But all the most progressive peasants were in the army. Discontent grew there, and soon, under the influence of the Bolsheviks sent by the Party to work in the army, soldiers also began to protest against the war.
      Tsarist soldiers at the front began fraternizing with German and Austrian soldiers. Similar fraternization occurred on other fronts of the warring states. The soldiers demanded an end to the bloody slaughter.
      During the war, oppressed peoples also began to rise up in revolutionary struggle against the tsarist government. Heavy extortion, cattle raiding, and violence against workers caused enormous discontent. This discontent intensified when people began to be drafted for work in the rear.
      In 1916, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Turkmens rebelled. They attacked cities, engaged in battle with tsarist troops and police, and killed their own volost elders—servants of the tsarist authorities.
      The Kazakhs formed their own armed combat units. The leader of the uprising was a brave hero of the Kazakh people, Amangeldy Imanov.
      The Uzbek rebels destroyed railway lines to prevent troop supplies, burned stations, and cut telegraph wires.
      In Kyrgyzstan, the rebels obtained weapons by seizing military transport. In the mountains, they built forges and workshops for producing gunpowder.
      The tsarist authorities sent troops with cannons, machine guns, and armored cars against the rebels. Amid the blood and smoke of burned villages and auls, they suppressed these uprisings.
      But the united struggle of workers, peasants, soldiers, and oppressed peoples against the war and the tsarist government steadily grew.
     
      <start><chap>52. The Overthrow of Tsarism in February 1917.
     
     Uprising in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>. <person>Tsar Nicholas II </person> and his ministers were at a loss as to how to cope with the defeat at the front and the impending revolution. They were at a loss for what to do. Even the bourgeois "Cadet" party and its leader, Miliukov, ceased supporting the Tsar due to defeats at the front; but the Cadets also feared revolution. The bourgeoisie decided to remove Nicholas II from power and install his brother Mikhail on the throne, suppress the nascent revolutionary movement, and continue the war.
      Those close to the Tsar advised Nicholas II to end the war, conclude a separate peace with the Germans, and then deal with the revolution.
      The plans of the Tsar and the bourgeoisie did not come to fruition. They were forestalled by an uprising of workers and soldiers, which began in February 1917.
      In early 1917, the starving and war-weary workers of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> went on strike. The Bolsheviks led the workers' struggle. They also infiltrated soldiers' barracks, calling on the army to support the workers in their fight against the Tsar. Working men and women took to the streets and demanded:
      "Down with the war!" Down with the tsarist government! Bread! Peace!
      Soon the workers began to understand that the tsarist government could not be defeated by a single strike; an armed uprising was necessary—and they rebelled.
      The tsarist ministers gave the order to shoot the workers without mercy. In the city center, police set up machine guns on rooftops and in attics and fired at the demonstrators.
      The heroic struggle of the <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> workers also drew soldiers into the revolution.
      On February 27, the troops in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> refused to fire on the workers and began to go over to the side of the people.
      The rebellious workers and soldiers arrested the tsarist ministers and imprisoned them. Imprisoned revolutionaries were released from prison. Crowds burned police and courthouses. Young workers and working women participated in the uprising alongside their brothers and husbands.
      Tsar Nicholas II, who was outside <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> at the time, sent troops from the front against the rebellious people. But revolutionary workers and soldiers rode out to meet them, explained what they were fighting for, and convinced the troops to disobey the orders of the tsar and the generals. The soldiers obeyed the workers. The revolution triumphed over the tsarist regime.
      When news of the revolution's victory in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> reached other cities and the front, workers and soldiers overthrew the tsarist regime locally as well.
      Following the example of the first revolution of 1905, Soviets were created everywhere, but these were no longer just Soviets of workers' deputies, but Soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies. This marked the difference between the February Revolution of 1917 and the revolution of 1905. The soldiers' deputies in the Soviets were, in essence, peasant deputies, disguised in soldiers' uniforms for the occasion. This meant that the Soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies were, in fact, Soviets of workers' and peasants' deputies. This meant that an alliance of workers and peasants against the tsarist regime had already formed, and the Soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies became the organs of this alliance.
      Without this alliance, the people could not have overthrown the tsar, and the revolution could not have triumphed.
      Two powers. The bourgeoisie managed to exploit the petty-bourgeois politicians, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, who constituted the majority in the Soviets, and with their help seized power in the country. Traitors to the revolution—the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries—enabled the bourgeoisie to establish their own bourgeois Provisional Government.
      But the Soviets continued to exist alongside the Provisional Government. Two powers emerged in the country.
     
      Upon arriving in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> on April 3, 1917, the leader of the proletariat, V. I. Lenin, was greeted by revolutionary sailors and soldiers.
     
      The bourgeoisie and the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries entrenched in the Soviets sought to continue the war with Germany to a victorious end. The land remained in the hands of the landowners. Capitalists continued to rob the workers. The oppression of the peoples of Russia remained.
      Lenin, in letters from abroad, and the Bolsheviks, led by Comrade Stalin, who had returned from exile, denounced the Provisional Government to the people and exposed the deceptions of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries.
      On April 3, 1917, Lenin returned to Russia with great difficulty from abroad. All of revolutionary <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>—workers, sailors, and soldiers—gathered to greet him. The cheers for Lenin were endless. Lenin climbed onto an armored car, spoke to the people, and into the hushed crowd he issued a fiery appeal: "Long live the world socialist revolution!" It was a call to fight against the bourgeois Provisional Government, to establish working-class power, and to fight for socialism.
     
      XII. The Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia
     
      </chap>
    <chap> 53. The Bolsheviks Prepare the Socialist Revolution
     
      . The masses follow the Bolsheviks. Upon Lenin's arrival, the party convened a conference of Bolsheviks. Delegates representing 80,000 party members from all over Russia converged on <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>. Molotov, Voroshilov, Sverdlov, Kuibyshev, Dzerzhinsky, and many others attended the conference. Lenin and Stalin presided over the conference. They pointed out that the working class had accomplished only its first task—the abolition of the tsarist autocracy in Russia. They said a second task still needed to be accomplished—the socialist revolution. They said the party still faced a serious and arduous struggle, because the bourgeoisie, which had come to dominate the country, would not relinquish power without fierce resistance.
      They called on the party to win a majority in the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, as well as in the Soviets of Peasants' Deputies, and to expel the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from them.
      Lenin and Stalin called on the Bolsheviks to organize the masses to fight for the socialist revolution. For the socialist revolution to succeed, they argued, the working class, in close alliance with the poor peasantry, must overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie. It was necessary to curb the bourgeoisie, wrest the land from the landowners and give it to the peasants for use, grant freedom to the oppressed peoples of Russia, and immediately end the war.
     
      The peasants demanded land. A fellow sailor called for the immediate, organized seizure of the landowners' lands.
     
      Lenin and Stalin's proposals were accepted by the conference. The Bolsheviks launched a massive campaign among the workers, soldiers, and sailors. They also launched a campaign among the peasants. They explained the conference's decisions and called on the people to fight against the Provisional Government for the establishment of Soviet power, an end to the war, and the immediate transfer of all land to the peasants.
      Workers' and soldiers' demonstrations began in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>. In April, a demonstration of workers and soldiers was organized. The demonstrators carried placards and banners with Bolshevik slogans:
      "Down with the war!
      " "Down with the capitalist ministers!
      " "All power to the Soviets!"
      The Provisional Government, together with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, was forced to remove the most hated capitalist ministers, Guchkov and Milyukov, from their posts and included several Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries in its ranks.
      But the government's policies remained unchanged. The war continued, landowners controlled the land, oppressed peoples remained disenfranchised, and workers were threatened with lockouts (the closure of enterprises).
      The revolutionary mood of the masses grew. They increasingly listened to the voice of the Bolsheviks. The Bolshevik Party grew stronger.
      In early June 1917, the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was held in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>.
      At this congress, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries still held a majority. They secured the congress's approval for support of the bourgeois government and an offensive at the front.
      The offensive at the front began then. It ended in defeat for the Russian army. The soldiers were reluctant to go into battle, refusing to fight for the interests of the bourgeoisie and demanding the transfer of all power to the Soviets. In vain did the Provisional Government's Minister of War, the Socialist Revolutionary Kerensky, try to persuade the soldiers to shed their blood for a cause alien to them. "The bourgeoisie needs the war," the soldiers replied, "let them fight themselves." The Provisional Government ordered the execution of soldiers who refused to go into battle.
      The soldiers became increasingly convinced of the betrayal of their interests by the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries and defected to the Bolsheviks. Demonstrations of workers and soldiers began again in Russia's major cities.
      The July demonstration and the mutiny of General Kornilov. The summer of 1917 arrived. The Provisional Government still had not satisfied a single demand of the workers, soldiers, peasants, and oppressed peoples of Russia.
      The devastation in industry and on the railways intensified. Factories and plants were shut down, there were no raw materials or fuel. There was a shortage of bread and meat. Famine was looming.
      The workers' struggle against the capitalists and their government intensified. Strikes were continuous. Workers organized their own armed units—the Red Guard. Peasant uprisings broke out in the villages.
      Soldiers left the front in the thousands. Oppressed peoples, denied liberation by the Provisional Government, came forward with their just demands.
      On July 3, 1917, masses of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> workers, soldiers, and sailors demonstrated under Bolshevik slogans. The bourgeoisie, in collusion with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, called in elite cadet and kulak military units from the front and executed the demonstration, smashing workers' organizations.
     
      Shooting of the demonstration on July 3, 1917, in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>.
     
      Cadets and officers attacked the editorial office of the newspaper Pravda. Bolsheviks were arrested and imprisoned. The Bolsheviks were forced to go underground again. The Provisional Government ordered Lenin's arrest. At the insistence of the Party, Lenin went into hiding. Lenin disguised himself as a worker and, with a passport in the name of a worker named Ivanov, lived in a hut on the outskirts of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>, near Sestroretsk, and some time later moved to Finland. Bourgeois bloodhounds hunted Lenin in vain. The workers protected their beloved leader by all means.
      The bourgeoisie raged in the rear and at the front. Even the most backward workers began to understand the consequences of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, who defended the interests of the bourgeoisie. More and more workers joined the ranks of the Bolsheviks. The membership of the Bolshevik Party increased to 200,000.
      At the end of July, the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party convened in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>.
      Lenin was not present at the congress. He was in hiding. Stalin led the congress. He called on the party to prepare for an armed uprising.
      The congress outlined the path to victory for the socialist revolution and developed measures to combat the economic devastation in the country.
      Delegates scattered across Russia began preparing workers and poor peasants for an uprising against the Provisional Government, to overthrow its authority, and to establish the power of the Soviets, the power of workers and peasants.
      Then the bourgeoisie and landowners organized a conspiracy against the revolution. On their instructions, General Kornilov assembled large detachments of officers, Cossacks, and backward troops and marched them on <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> to smash the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, strangle the workers and peasants, and declare himself the absolute ruler of Russia.
      At the call of the Bolsheviks, the workers of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> and the <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> troops rose up. Revolutionary agitators—workers and soldiers—sent to meet Kornilov's troops told Kornilov's soldiers of their general's true intentions. The soldiers of Kornilov's regiments refused to oppose the revolution. The bourgeoisie's conspiracy failed. Under pressure from the workers and peasants, Kerensky was forced to arrest Kornilov and imprison him.
      The workers' and soldiers' victory over Kornilov further strengthened the Bolshevik Party's influence.
      After the Kornilov rebellion, workers and soldiers began expelling the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the Soviets and electing Bolsheviks in their place. In the fall of 1917, the majority of the <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> and Moscow Soviets went over to the Bolsheviks. The Soviets became the true centers of the proletarian revolution. They armed the workers, created the Red Guard, and prepared for an armed uprising.
      In early October, Lenin, hiding from the bourgeois government, appeared in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> to lead the uprising. Lenin declared that the workers' victory was now assured, that an armed uprising must be launched immediately, the government of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks, and the Socialist Revolutionaries must be overthrown, and the power of the Soviets must be established.
     
    </chap><chap>54. The socialist revolution triumphed.
     
      The victorious uprising of October 25 (November 7), 1917. The Bolshevik Party was preparing for the final, decisive battle—the overthrow of bourgeois power by force of arms.
      The moment for the uprising was well chosen. The world war continued. In Russia, the majority of workers followed the Bolsheviks. The compromising Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties had lost the trust of the working people. Many Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies were in Bolshevik hands. The workers had their own strong trade unions and the Red Guard. The peasants did not want to wait for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, as the compromising Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties advised them to do, and followed the Bolsheviks, who demanded the immediate seizure of the landowners' lands. They expelled the landowners from their namedays and seized the land. The soldiers did not want to continue the war. They rejected Kerensky's order to fight to the bitter end and demanded peace. Not only Russian workers and peasants, but also the peoples of Transcaucasia, Ukraine, Belarus, Central Asia, and Finland rose up against Kerensky's Provisional Government. The Bolsheviks vigorously prepared for the uprising. Its plan was carefully developed.
     
      V. I. Lenin (1870–1924)
     
      Lenin and Stalin among the Red Guards.
     
      But in the most decisive days of preparation for the uprising, Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Trotsky betrayed the plans and dates of the uprising to the bourgeoisie. The Provisional Government, having learned of the uprising from traitors, urgently mobilized troops loyal to it to fight it. But the days of bourgeois rule were numbered. The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party created a combat center to lead the uprising, headed by Comrade Stalin. Following Lenin's instructions, on October 24, 1917, the combat center launched the uprising. Lenin stood at its head.

      As one, the Red Guards, revolutionary soldiers, and sailors of Kronstadt rose up in response to the call of the Bolshevik Party. The courage, revolutionary drive, and discipline of the revolutionary soldiers quickly did their job. All government institutions and military posts in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> were occupied by the Red Guards. The ministers of the Provisional Government, along with detachments of officers and cadets, fortified themselves in the Winter Palace. On October 25, revolutionary troops surrounded the palace. The revolutionary cruiser Aurora and three destroyers entered the Neva River. The siege of the palace lasted until evening. Darkness fell. Only the enormous Winter Palace remained illuminated. Toward nightfall, the fighting intensified. Machine guns rattled. Rifle volleys rang out. A firefight broke out between the troops entrenched in the palace and the advancing revolutionaries. The Red Guards began their assault on the palace.
     
      Revolutionary sailors storm the Winter Palace in October 1917.
     
      The Bolsheviks, who had led the capture of the Winter Palace, offered the besieged forces the opportunity to surrender. They refused. The signal was given. The cannons of the Peter and Paul Fortress opened fire on the Winter Palace. The guns of the cruiser Aurora roared. The artillery fire had its effect. The machine guns in the palace fell silent. The revolutionary troops stormed the palace. The officers and cadets continued to fire back, but soon they surrendered. The Red Guards entered the palace's circular room through a narrow corridor. Several frightened people sat at tables. This was the last bourgeois government in Russia. Kerensky was not there, having managed to escape and hide.
      In the name of the revolution, all the ministers were declared under arrest. Those arrested were taken to the fortress.
      The proletarian revolution had triumphed throughout the country. The working class celebrated its victory. On October 25, the people of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> read Lenin's proclamation with profound emotion. It declared that the Provisional Government had fallen, and power had passed into the hands of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. The cause for which the people had fought—ending the war, abolishing landlord ownership of land, and establishing a Soviet government—was assured.
      It was now possible to establish workers' control over factories and plants to combat economic devastation.
      The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies opened at the same time. Lenin submitted, and the congress approved, the first three decrees of the Great Proletarian Revolution: on peace, on land, and on power.
      The Decree on Peace proposed that all belligerent states immediately begin negotiations to end the war and conclude a peace on the basis of equality.
      The Decree on Land abolished the landlord class, abolished private landownership, and transferred it to the use of all working people. Peasants received over 150 million hectares of land from the Soviet government.
      The Decree on Power transferred all power in the country to the Soviets.
      Our country became a Soviet Republic.
      The Congress elected the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars. V. I. Lenin became the head of the Council of People's Commissars. Comrade Stalin was elected People's Commissar for Nationalities.
      Soon after the Congress, Comrade Sverdlov was elected Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.
      News of the proletariat's victory in <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> quickly spread throughout the country. In a number of cities, workers had to wage fierce battles to seize power.
     
        <person>Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov (1885–1919).</person>
     
      In Moscow, officers and cadets seized the Kremlin and a number of large buildings. Red Guard workers were forced to dig trenches and wage a real war against counterrevolutionaries. Fighting raged in Moscow for a whole week. Only with cannon fire did the workers and soldiers force the officers and cadets to surrender.
      Telegrams about the transfer of power to the Soviets flew from all Russian cities to <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>. The peoples of Siberia, Central Asia, Belarus, the Volga region, and the left bank of Ukraine, with the help of the Soviet government, were liberating themselves from centuries-old oppression by the bourgeoisie and landowners.
     
      The capture of the Kremlin by insurgent workers in Moscow in the October days of 1917.
     
      The victory of the socialist Soviet revolution is thus explained by the following reasons:
      1) The bourgeois government of the Socialist Revolutionary Kerensky had completely failed in the eyes of the workers and peasants. Kerensky sought to continue the war to a victorious conclusion, while the workers, peasants, and soldiers demanded an end to the war and the conclusion of peace. Kerensky sought to preserve the lands for the landowners, while the workers and peasants demanded the immediate seizure of the landowners' lands for the peasants. Kerensky sought to curb the workers, while the workers and peasants demanded the curbing of factory owners and the establishment of workers' organizations over them.
      2) The second reason is that, on the basis of these demands, a strong alliance of workers and peasants was formed and consolidated in the form of the Sonnets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies against the bourgeois Provisional Government and its lackeys—the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks—in support of the Bolshevik Party.
      3) The third reason is that the workers and peasants en masse abandoned the compromising Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks and rallied around the Bolshevik Party, recognizing it as their leader and guide.
      Without these reasons, the October Revolution could not have succeeded.
      The Bolshevik Party organized the Soviet state. From the very first days of the victory of the Great Proletarian Revolution, Lenin and Stalin began organizing the Soviet state as a fraternal socialist union of all peoples. The peoples of Russia received from Soviet power complete liberation, such as no other people in the world had ever experienced.
     
        <person>Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky </person>(1877–1926).
     
      Following the decrees on peace and land, a decree on workers' control was issued. Workers' control was established over capitalists in factories and plants, over the production, storage, purchase, and sale of all food products and raw materials.
      The Council of People's Commissars declared a refusal to pay all debts to foreign states.
      However, defeated in the capital and the country's centers, the enemies of Soviet power—landowners, capitalists, generals, and priests, along with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries—fled to the outskirts of Russia.
      In the Don region, in right-bank Ukraine, in the Caucasus, in the Orenburg steppes, and in Siberia, they attempted to consolidate their position and organize a campaign against Soviet power. But their own forces were weak, and the workers and peasants did not follow them. The rebellions and conspiracies staged by the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries failed. The Red Guard and the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution (VChK), headed by F. E. Dzerzhinsky, were sufficient to suppress these plots by the Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and their Cadets allies.
      The Soviet government's fight against counterrevolutionary conspiracies later became much more difficult when the Cadet and Socialist Revolutionary-Menshevik rebels began to receive direct military support from capitalist states. This constituted a military intervention by capitalist states against Soviet power and the Soviet system. The Soviets' struggle against this intervention lasted for three full years.
     
      XIII. Military intervention. Civil war
     
    </chap><chap>55. The Soviets' struggle for peace. The Germans' seizure of Ukraine.
     
      Peace with Germany. Although the war continued, the old Russian army was no longer capable of fighting, and soldiers fled to their homes. Soldiers returned home on the roofs of train cars, on the buffers and brakes of trains. Exhausted by the war, the country and the army needed a respite. The Council of People's Commissars, based on a decree adopted at the Second Congress of Soviets, appealed to all belligerent powers with a proposal to conclude a general peace. The governments of England and France, then joined by the United States of America, responded to this appeal with silence. Germany and its allies, more exhausted by the war than England and France, entered into peace negotiations with the Soviet government. Germany wanted to retain some of the lands conquered from Russia. The arrogant German generals were forced to negotiate with delegates of workers and peasants from the Land of Soviets. The Germans presented the Soviet delegation with extortionate peace terms.
      Since the old army had collapsed, and a new regular Red Army had not yet been created and could not be created on such short notice, the Soviets could no longer continue the war. Therefore, Lenin obliged Trotsky, who was part of the delegation, to sign a peace treaty with the Germans. But Trotsky, clearly playing into the Germans' hands and provoking them to launch a new offensive against the unarmed Soviet Union, disrupted the peace negotiations. The Germans took advantage of this, launched a new offensive, and occupied part of Soviet territory. German troops were approaching <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>. At Lenin's insistence, peace with the Germans was hastily concluded in the city of Brest. This was the Brest Peace Treaty.
      In addition to the loss of Soviet territory occupied by the Germans, they were forced to agree to other concessions to Germany. The traitor Trotsky and his henchman Bukharin did everything they could to disrupt the Brest Peace Treaty and betray the young Soviet Republic.
     
      The Red Army, in the early days of its organization.
     
      Lenin and Stalin, agreeing to an unfavorable peace, had no doubt that the time would come when the revolution would triumph in Germany, and Soviet power in Russia would have time to create the Red Army, grow stronger, and be able to restore what had been lost. With the conclusion of the Brest-Litovsk Peace, the Soviet government gained a respite and began to build the national economy and create and strengthen the Red Army. The Red Army was created in 1918.
      The Germans seized Soviet lands. Although the Brest-Litovsk Peace, concluded by the Soviet government with the Germans, extended to the entire territory of the Soviet state, including Ukraine, some Ukrainian delegates, bribed by the Germans, refused to submit to the Soviet government and concluded their own separate peace treaty with the Germans. By virtue of this treacherous treaty, Ukraine was declared not a Soviet republic, but a bourgeois republic. If the Soviets resisted, the Germans pledged to support the Ukrainian bourgeois government, then known as the Ukrainian Rada, with their troops. The German invaders took advantage of this treaty and entered Ukraine with their troops. They captured Ukraine, then the Don and Georgia. The advancing German army dispersed the Soviets along the way, hanging Bolsheviks and workers and peasants who supported Soviet power.
      The Red Army was still very weak at the time, but it did not cede Soviet lands to the Germans without a fight. At the head of the workers' detachments of Donetsk miners, poor rural peasants, and revolutionary sailors stood a favorite of the workers, a Lugansk mechanic, a selflessly brave Bolshevik, and one of the best disciples of Lenin and Stalin—Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov.
      For a month and a half, Voroshilov's troops fought off the advancing Germans and White Cossack detachments on the Don. On the Don, the Cossacks blew up a bridge. Under a hail of bullets and shells from the White Cossacks, the Red Army soldiers built a bridge across the Don. Some worked, others fought the Cossacks. Voroshilov encouraged the soldiers, instilled confidence in his troops with his example of personal bravery, and managed to get the Red Army across the Don to Tsaritsyn (now Stalingrad).
      German and Austrian troops captured all of Ukraine. The Germans installed a major Ukrainian landowner, the tsarist general Skoropadsky, as hetman in Ukraine and returned the lands to the landowners and the factories to the capitalists.
     
      Nikolai Shchors is a hero of the Ukrainian Civil War.
     
      Labor organizations in Ukraine were banned. Bullets, gallows, and abuses at the hands of landowners, capitalists, and the German military descended upon the working class and peasants of Ukraine. The Germans confiscated livestock from peasants and emptied their barns of grain. Trains carrying Ukrainian grain, sugar, lard, meat, coal, and iron ore departed daily for Germany and Austria. The plunder and violence of the German invaders roused Ukrainian workers and peasants to struggle. Nikolai Shchors, the son of a railroad worker, became particularly famous for his courageous fight against the Germans. He fought the enemies of the Ukrainian workers and peasants as heroically as Vasily Ivanovich Chapayev, a hero of the Russian people. But the Germans did not hold out long in Ukraine. German soldiers barely fought off the rebellious Ukrainian workers and peasants. And when revolution broke out in Germany at the end of 1918, the German soldiers fled to Germany. Ukraine became Soviet again.
      The predatory Brest-Litovsk Treaty with the Germans was annulled by the Soviet government.
     
    </chap><chap>56. The Soviet Republic surrounded by intervention and counterrevolution.
     
      Factories and plants are state property. The struggle for bread. Russia, devastated by the World War, began the socialist revolution amidst the extreme decline of the entire national economy. Manufacturers and plant owners refused to submit to workers' control. They damaged and broke machines, neglected to repair them, left factories and plants without raw materials and fuel, and sometimes closed their enterprises altogether. The Soviet government waged a decisive struggle against these enemies, who were trying to strangle the revolution in this way.
     
      Workers' control was established in factories.
     
      Banks, railways, and then factories and plants were taken away from the capitalists. In 1918, capitalist enterprises became the property of the Soviet state. Workers and Soviet engineers were appointed directors of factories and plants. But due to a shortage of fuel and raw materials, many factories and plants could not be immediately put into operation.
      The country was short of grain. The kulaks, brutal enemies of the revolution, hid grain in pits, let it rot, and sold it to speculators, all to avoid feeding the Soviet state and the Red Army. The supply of grain to Russia's worker centers from grain-producing regions was cut off by counterrevolutionaries and interventionists who rose up against Soviet power. Famine threatened to destroy the revolution.
     
      A meeting of the Village Poor Committee in 1918.
     
      At Lenin's call, workers created food detachments to collect surplus grain in the villages and fight the kulaks. At Lenin's suggestion, committees of the poor (kombedy) were organized in the villages. They assisted the food detachments in taking grain from the kulaks and gave the poor horses and cattle confiscated from the kulaks.
      The Party and the Poor Peasants' Committees also attracted the middle peasantry to an alliance and friendship with the working class and the poor. The middle peasants, seeing that the Soviet government, which had given them land, was protecting them from the landlords and defeating their enemies, began to fight for the Soviets together with the working class and the poor.
      The United States, England, France, and Japan began military intervention in the Land of Soviets. The foreign bourgeoisie feared that the sparks of revolutionary fire in Russia would ignite revolutions throughout the world. Foreign capitalists also could not accept the fact that they were losing the opportunity to receive enormous income from Russia on their capital invested in Russia before the revolution. In alliance with Russian landlords and the bourgeoisie, the governments of England, France, and Japan launched a civil war against the Soviet government. In the spring of 1918, Czechoslovaks, captured by the Russians during the World War, with the support of France, launched a counterrevolutionary uprising against Soviet Russia. The Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, together with the Czechoslovaks, seized part of the Volga region, the Urals, and Siberia. In the summer of 1918, the British landed troops in Arkhangelsk on the White Sea and helped the White Guards overthrow Soviet power. The Japanese landed troops in Vladivostok.
      All these bourgeois states that had begun the war against Soviet power were then called the Entente, meaning alliance or allies.
      The Entente stirred up uprisings in various cities of Soviet Russia with the help of the Cadets, Mensheviks, and Socialist Revolutionaries. The bourgeoisie bribed bandits to assassinate the leaders of the revolution. The Bolshevik Uritsky and the Bolshevik Voldarsky, a favorite orator of the <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> workers, were killed. In the fall of 1918, after a rally at a Moscow factory, the Socialist Revolutionaries attempted to assassinate V. I. Lenin. The Socialist Revolutionaries, together with the Bukharinites and Trotskyists, were plotting an uprising. Lenin, bleeding profusely, was taken home. For many days, Vladimir Ilyich struggled with death. All workers followed the progress of their beloved leader's illness. A sigh of relief and joy escaped them when the recovered Ilyich returned to governing the state.
      By this time, the Entente powers had seized the White Sea coast, the Urals, and Siberia. White Cossacks attempted to capture Tsaritsyn, a major city on the Volga, and cut off grain supplies to the center of the country. The Bolshevik Central Committee sent Comrade Stalin to defend Tsaritsyn. Here, Stalin met with Voroshilov, who had arrived with Red troops from Donbass. Day and night, without rest, Stalin worked to strengthen the Tsaritsyn front. He rooted out traitors who had infiltrated the Red Army's rear, ensured the armament and supply of the troops, and sent grain down the Volga to the workers of Moscow, <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>, and other cities. The White Cossacks attempted to take Tsaritsyn several times, but to no avail. Stalin and Voroshilov dealt the Cossacks blow after blow and defended this important city on the Volga.
      Along with Tsaritsyn, Astrakhan, where Comrade Kirov led the Red Army, also fought the Whites. The Whites never managed to capture Astrakhan.
      Civil war in Transcaucasia and Central Asia. Germany helped the Mensheviks, enemies of the Georgian people, gain a foothold in Georgia. The Georgian Mensheviks came to power through bloodshed. They executed many workers and peasants fighting for Soviet power.
      Armenian workers and peasants also failed to immediately free themselves from bourgeois oppression. In Armenia, the Entente supported the enemies of the Armenian people, the Dashnaks.
     
      The execution of 26 Baku Bolshevik commissars in 1918.
     
      The Turks intended to seize Baku in Azerbaijan, with its large oil industry. In 1918, Soviet power reigned in Baku. The Baku Soviet was led by the Bolshevik Stepan Shaumyan and other old Bolsheviks—friends and disciples of Comrade Stalin. Baku nationalists, ostensibly to save the city from the Turks, invited British troops to Baku in the summer of 1918. Having occupied the city, the British arrested Shaumyan, Azizbekov, Japaridze, and other Baku commissars—26 in all—taken them to Turkmenistan, and executed them there.
      In Turkmenistan, the British destroyed Soviet power and installed a wholly obedient government of White Guards—the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.
      In Khiva and Bukhara, the British helped the enemies of the Uzbek people—the Khan of Khiva and the Emir of Bukharan—retain power.
     
    </chap><chap>57. Revolution in Western Europe
     
      . The November Revolution in Germany. The Great Proletarian Revolution in Russia divided the world into two camps. On one-sixth of the globe, in Russia, the power of the proletariat—the builder of socialism—was strengthened.
      Soviet Russia, like a beacon, illuminated the path to the victory of socialism for workers in capitalist countries. The first Western European workers to rise up were the German proletarians. Germany's defeat in the World War accelerated open mass rebellion. In November 1918, an uprising broke out in German cities, in workers' centers, and in the army and navy on ships. The uprising soon spread to Austria.
      Workers overthrew the emperors of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Along with their generals and confidants, they fled the people's wrath to other countries. Republics were declared in Germany and Austria.
      Soviets began to form in Germany, but they were overwhelmingly composed of traitors to the revolution—German Mensheviks and Social Democrats.
      The bourgeoisie and its loyal servants, the Social Democrats, formed armed units to fight the workers. These units crushed the workers' uprisings fighting for the transfer of all power to the Soviets. The workers' uprising in the German capital, Berlin, which began in early 1919, was suppressed by the White Guards. Masses of workers died in revolutionary battles, and thousands of the revolution's best fighters were imprisoned.
      German workers' leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were arrested and killed.
      The proletarian uprising was crushed. The bourgeoisie and its allies, the Social Democrats, came to power. A few years later, the bourgeoisie ousted the Social Democrats from the government.
      Soviet republics in Bavaria and Hungary. In only one part of Germany, Bavaria, in 1919 did the workers defeat the bourgeoisie and establish their own government—the Soviet Republic.
      The German bourgeoisie mobilized White Guard gangs, spies, and traitors to the revolution against the Bavarian workers' government. For two weeks, Bavarian workers heroically repelled enemy attacks, but their forces were weak. The workers were defeated.
      At the same time, a proletarian revolution began in Germany's neighbor, Hungary. In March 1919, Soviet power emerged victorious in Hungary. A workers' government took over the Soviet Republic. The Hungarian Red Army was created. Factories, plants, mines, banks, and railroads were declared the property of a workers' state. Working families moved from dark and damp basements into bright and spacious houses confiscated from the rich. Lenin, Stalin, and the entire Soviet people warmly welcomed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. But troops from neighboring bourgeois countries advanced on tiny Soviet Hungary from all sides. Soviet Hungary was strangled by them.
      The Communist International. The revolution in Germany and Hungary failed because there was no revolutionary Bolshevik party in these countries at the time. The workers followed the traitors—the leaders of the Second International. Even before the World War, Lenin fought against these traitors. During the World War, Lenin led the struggle to create a new, Third International, the Communist International.
      During the revolution in the West, during the workers' strikes and peasant movements that intensified after the World War, communist parties emerged in a number of European countries. On
      March 2, 1919, representatives of communist parties from all over the world, from various countries—Germany, England, France, Poland, Switzerland, Iran, Norway, the USA, China, and Korea—risked their lives, hiding from spies, and made their way to Moscow for the first congress.
      At this congress, the Third Communist International (Comintern) was founded, the leader of the working class throughout the world.
     
    </chap><chap>58. The defeat of Kolchak, Denikin, and Yudenich
     
      . Kolchak was a protege of the Entente. The Entente bourgeoisie decided to destroy the Soviets in Russia. It sent its troops to northern Russia, Siberia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Ukraine. The Entente organized armies and campaigns of counterrevolutionary Russian generals against Moscow.
      In Siberia in 1918, the Entente declared Tsarist Admiral Kolchak the supreme ruler of Russia. They supplied Kolchak with cannons, shells, rifles, and uniforms for his soldiers.
      Kolchak created a White Army. He mercilessly executed workers and flogged and killed peasants. Throughout Siberia, he restored tsarist order.
      Tsarist officers, landowners, capitalists, and priests flocked to Kolchak from all corners of Russia, seeing him as the best defender of their interests.
      Kolchak soon launched an offensive against Soviet Russia. He succeeded in capturing the city of Perm.
      To defeat Kolchak, the Bolshevik Party mobilized and threw its best forces to the front. In the Urals, the Bolsheviks strengthened the front and halted the advance of the White armies.
      In the spring of 1919, Kolchak, on orders from the Entente, launched a campaign against Soviet Russia. A terrible threat to Soviet power loomed from the east. General Denikin was advancing from the south to Kolchak's aid, while General Yudenich was advancing on <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> from the west. The Soviet people were now threatened by enemies on all sides. They were supplied by foreign capitalists.
      But the main enemy at this time was Kolchak. The main forces of the Red Army were sent there. Red Army soldiers fought selflessly against Kolchak's army. Red commanders and Bolshevik political commissars, together with the soldiers, went on the offensive in difficult times and were the first to attack Kolchak's forces, inspiring the Red Army soldiers with their courage, bravery, and fearlessness.
     
      Vasily Ivanovich Chapayev was a hero of the Civil War.
     
      M.V. Frunze commanded the Red Army forces here. Under his leadership, the Red Army defeated Kolchak in the Volga region and the Urals in 1919. Vasily Ivanovich Chapayev, a national hero, emerged in Frunze's army. The Whites feared Chapayev's division like the plague. Kolchak repeatedly sent troops against Chapaev that were many times superior to his own, yet Chapaev always emerged victorious from battles with the Whites. Once surrounded by the White Army, Chapaev and his staff perished.
      But despite some losses, the Red Army finally defeated Kolchak in the fall of 1919 and drove the remnants of his army beyond the Urals, into Siberia.
     
      Siberian partisans with homemade guns attacked Kolchak's units.
     
      At this time, workers and peasants in Siberia rebelled against Kolchak and formed partisan detachments everywhere.
      In December 1919, the workers of Irkutsk revolted and captured Kolchak and his ministers. The Revolutionary Committee executed Kolchak.
      The Red Army celebrated victory in Siberia.
      The foreign invaders were forced to flee from Western and Eastern Siberia. The Red Army, with the help of Siberian partisans—Russian workers and peasants, Buryat-Mongols, Yakuts, Evenks, Altai peoples, and other peoples of Siberia—expelled them from our country.
      Denikin and Yudenich were Entente stooges. Kolchak's defeat did not stop the Entente's struggle against the Soviet Republic. Foreign powers organized a new campaign against the Soviet Union. General Denikin achieved success in the south, capturing several regions of the Don and Ukraine. The Entente provided him with military assistance, as it had to Kolchak. Denikin assembled a large army from the mobilized population and White Cossacks and, under the command of counterrevolutionary officers, marched it on Moscow.
      The Soviet government concentrated all its forces against Denikin. Lenin addressed a letter to all party organizations, calling on them: "Everyone to fight Denikin!" The Bolshevik Party sent its finest to the Southern Front. Many thousands of workers and peasants joined the party and went to the front. Many Komsomol organizations went to the front en masse. Notices could be seen on the doors of several Komsomol committees: "The committee is closed; everyone has gone to the front." By the autumn of 1919, the Red Army numbered up to two and a half million workers and peasants in its ranks.
      The Central Committee of the Party instructed Comrade Stalin to organize the defeat of Denikin. Stalin quickly became aware of the dire situation at the front and developed a plan to defeat Denikin's White Guards.
      By this time, Denikin had already occupied all of Ukraine and was approaching the heart of the revolution—Moscow. This was the most dangerous time for the revolution. By seizing Soviet territory, Denikin everywhere restored the power of landowners and capitalists. He transferred land to landowners, factories and plants to industrialists, exacted heavy taxes from the population, and executed communists and workers and peasants fighting for Soviet power. Denikin's officers burned villages and carried out pogroms against Jews.
      The Red Army's task was to defeat the advancing White Guards. S. M. Budyonny's Cavalry Corps attacked Denikin's regiments in October 1919. Budyonny swooped down on Voronezh with his invincible cavalry, decisively routing the White cavalry there.
      Following the cavalry, the Red Army's shock regiments advanced against the Whites from Orel. Comrade Ordzhonikidze commanded military operations here. Denikin's White Army succumbed to the crushing onslaught of the Soviet troops and rolled south.
      In the winter snowstorm and icy conditions, Budyonny's Red Army regiments and cavalry continued, almost relentlessly, to drive the Whites further and further, toward the Black Sea. Denikin's forces retreated in panic, and partisan uprisings arose in their rear. These rebellions were particularly widespread in the Northern Caucasus. Under the leadership of Comrade Kirov and other Bolsheviks, workers and peasants from the mountain peoples launched raids against Denikin's forces. The rebels captured towns from the Whites, killing landowners and officers. Larger detachments waged actual battles against the White troops.
      Simultaneously with Denikin, the Entente sent General Yudenich's army to <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> to support him. Yudenich approached <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> in October 1919.
      The workers of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> formed a steel wall to defend the first city of the revolution. Day and night, workers and their families dug trenches and erected barbed wire entanglements. <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place> was transformed into an impregnable fortress. Tens of thousands of workers and Komsomol members joined the ranks of <place element = "city" > Petrograd </place>'s defenders. They launched an offensive and dealt Yudenich a fatal blow at the end of 1919. The remnants of his army were driven back into Estonia.
      This time, the Entente's campaign again ended in the complete defeat of the White generals. Denikin and Yudenich fled abroad. The Entente hastily withdrew its troops from the Soviet Union. The Red Army drove them from Arkhangelsk and Murmansk. The peoples of Ukraine and the North Caucasus were becoming free from the oppression of landowners and capitalists, tsarist generals and foreign invaders. The Red Army helped them become full citizens of the Soviet Union.
      Only in Crimea did General Wrangel and the remnants of Denikin's troops still remain. And to the west, Poland, under orders from the Entente, was gathering strength for a new campaign against Soviet Russia.
     
    </chap><chap>59. War with the Polish lords. The defeat of Wrangel.
     
      War with White Poland. The year 1920 arrived. The Entente continued to wage war against the Soviet Republic. Now it set Poland against the Soviets.
      Poland was restored as an independent state only in late 1918. The Great Proletarian Revolution granted the Polish people the right to secede from Russia. The Polish lords in power in Poland did not appreciate this.
      As early as 1919, they seized Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and part of Ukraine.
      The Council of People's Commissars repeatedly proposed to the Poles that they cease their seizures and violence against the Belarusian and Ukrainian civilian populations and conclude peace, but the Polish gentry would hear of it. The Polish gentry dreamed of seizing Ukraine as far as the Black Sea. The Entente supplied the Poles with cannons, machine guns, and rifles. France gave them up to 135 aircraft and its best military specialists. In the spring of 1920, the Poles marched on Soviet Russia and captured Kiev. Having crossed the Dnieper, the Polish army prepared to seize left-bank Ukraine as well. The Poles hoped to link up with the remnants of Denikin's army, entrenched in Crimea under the command of Baron Wrangel—another Entente puppet.
      The Red Army was quickly pulled together from various fronts to attack the Polish invaders. Budyonny's cavalry army was sent from the Caucasus Front to the Polish Front. The dashing cavalrymen marched a thousand kilometers at a rapid pace without dismounting. Budyonny's cavalry advanced behind the Poles and struck them near Kyiv.
      The Poles fled, relentlessly pressed by Red Army units. The Red Army soon liberated Belarus and approached the capital of Poland, Warsaw. But the Red Army did not take Warsaw and was forced to retreat.
      The Poles, despite the retreat of Soviet troops, had lost so much strength in the war that they could no longer advance and offered peace to Soviet Russia. The Soviet government agreed to peace, and in the fall of 1920, the war ended. Belarus and Ukraine regained their lands previously seized by the Polish lords. However, some Ukrainians and Belarusians living in Western Ukraine and Western Belarus remained under Polish rule.
      Wrangel's defeat. One more major enemy of the Soviet state remained – Baron Wrangel. With the help of the Entente, Wrangel built strong fortifications at Perekop on the Crimean Isthmus. The party and government commissioned M.V. Frunze to defeat Wrangel. Together with Voroshilov, Frunze, following Comrade Stalin's instructions, meticulously prepared the offensive.
      Fierce fighting began. Defeated in Ukraine, Wrangel entrenched himself behind his fortifications in Crimea. On the third anniversary of the proletarian revolution, on the orders of M.V. Frunze, on the night of November 7-8, an assault on Wrangel's Perekop fortifications began. The Red Army's offensive was conducted across completely open terrain. The White Guards fired powerful cannons at the Red Army soldiers and rained bullets from machine guns. Despite this, the heroic Red Army soldiers advanced on the Whites' concrete fortifications. Under heavy fire, the Red Army soldiers broke into the enemy trenches and overthrew them. The Battle of Perekop ended in victory for the Red Army. The White Guards fled in panic. Wrangel, with the remnants of his troops, boarded ships and fled across the Black Sea to his protectors, the Entente.
      Neither the Poles nor Wrangel helped the Entente crush Soviet power in our country. The third and final campaign of the Entente failed just as the first two had.
     
      Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze (1885–1925).
     
      Establishment of Soviet power in Central Asia and Transcaucasia. The population of Central Asia endured terrible hardships during the civil war. Foreign invaders, kulaks (beys), and mullahs organized Basmachi bandit gangs. The Basmachi robbed the population and burned villages and auls. Lenin and Stalin sent a large number of Red units under the command of M.V. Frunze and V.V. Kuibyshev to the aid of the workers of Central Asia. In sandy deserts and rocky mountains, the Red Army destroyed the Basmachi gangs, liberating Central Asia from the rule of its oppressors.
      In 1920, Uzbek workers rebelled against the Khan's rule in Khiva. They defeated the Khan's troops and established a people's government. Following Khiva, a rebellion also broke out in Bukhara. The workers, aided by the Red Army, overthrew the Emir's rule and established a people's government. At the same time, the Turkmen also liberated themselves from foreign invaders.
      In the spring of 1920, workers' and peasants' uprisings began in Transcaucasia, where bourgeois nationalists ruled with the support of the Entente. Red Army units led by Comrades Ordzhonikidze, Kirov, and Mikoyan came to their aid. The bourgeois government was overthrown, and the peoples of Transcaucasia—Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia—joined the united family of nations of the Soviet Union.
      Now the main enemies of the workers and peasants were defeated and expelled from Soviet soil. Soviet power triumphed over foreign and Russian capitalists because the Communist Party led the workers. The Party rallied the workers and peasants to fight their enemies and was able to utilize all the country's resources to defeat them.
      Workers from Germany, England, and France provided significant assistance to the Soviet Republic in defeating the interventionists. They prevented the shipment by rail and sea of ​​weapons and equipment intended for the fight against the Soviets. They demanded an end to the struggle against the Soviet Republic and waged the struggle under the slogan: "Hands off Soviet Russia!"
      Having defeated the interventionists, the workers of the Soviet Union could now return to peaceful work on the farm, begin building socialism, and heal the grave wounds inflicted by the world and civil wars.
     
      XIV. Transition to Peaceful Work to Rebuild the Country's Economy
     
    </chap><chap>60. Rebuilding the National Economy. The Creation of the USSR:
     
      Lenin's Plan for Escape from Devastation. The world war and the civil war imposed by the Entente and counterrevolutionaries had brought the country to utter ruin. Many factories and plants were idle: there was no fuel or raw materials, broken locomotives and mangled carriages littered the railroad tracks. Bridges and railroad tracks had been blown up in many places by the Whites and had to be rebuilt. Industry produced five times less goods than before the war.
      Peasant fields were poorly cultivated. Much livestock had been taken away during the Tsarist war. Many were killed during the Civil War. Agriculture yielded half as much food as in 1914. There was famine in the country.
      Private trade was prohibited during the Civil War. Peasants, accustomed to trade, expressed discontent at this time. The bourgeoisie and kulaks, taking advantage of this discontent, roused peasants in several places to revolt against Soviet rule.
      The Party and the Soviet government decided to implement a number of measures to improve the country's economy.
      Vladimir Ilyich proposed the following plan in 1921. During the Civil War, peasants donated all their surplus grain to industry, workers, and the Red Army. Workers and peasants had formed a military alliance against landowners and factory owners. Now they needed an alliance to restore the economy and build socialism. Let the peasants not give all their surplus to the state, but pay a precisely defined tax in kind. They could dispose of their remaining products as they wish. To this end, private trade must be permitted. Private industrialists and merchants should be allowed to open small businesses and conduct trade. For the time being, let private industrialists and merchants produce and trade goods. "We will quickly grow stronger and displace private capital. And the time will come when we will completely eliminate the remnants of capitalists and kulaks in our country," Lenin said. Lenin's plan was adopted. It was called the New Economic Policy (NEP).
      To speed up economic recovery, the Communist Party, as it had during the Civil War, held subbotniks (workdays) for the first time. All workers participated. They worked for free for the benefit of their homeland.
      Lenin's plan proved successful. Within three to four years, the country's economy was firmly on its feet: factories and plants began operating, and the railways improved. Agriculture also boomed. Peasants brought grain, meat, and eggs to the markets. They began sowing beets and flax, and increased cotton cultivation. Sugar refineries and textile factories began operating across the country.
      Workers and peasants now had access to grain, sugar, fabrics, and many other goods. Many state-owned and cooperative stores opened. These enterprises began to displace private traders.
      Vladimir Ilyich Lenin—that mountain eagle, as Stalin called him—had a far-reaching vision. He said that workers and peasants could easily overcome devastation and lead happy lives. They would have to have factories within their own economy where machines were made, and these machines would have to run on electricity. The entire country, Lenin said more than once, needed to be covered with a network of power plants. A plan for the country's electrification was developed. At Lenin's suggestion, construction began on the first large water-powered electric power station on the Volkhov River, near Leningrad. In 1926, after Lenin's death, the station was completed and provided electricity to Leningrad's factories and plants. This helped restore Leningrad's vital industry.
      Power stations were also built in other parts of the country: in the Urals, Ukraine, and Transcaucasia.
      The end of the Japanese intervention. While the entire Soviet Union was rebuilding its economy, our rich land—the Far East—had been under Japanese control since 1918. But in 1922, the Red Army, together with Siberian partisans, ended the war here too and liberated the entire Far East from Japanese bandits and White Guards. Red soldiers won glorious victories in battles against the White and Japanese forces near Spassk and Volochayevka. Near the village of Volochayevka, the White Guards erected strong barbed wire entanglements. In winter, in the bitter cold, naked and almost barefoot, Red soldiers marched to the entanglements, tearing the wire with their bare hands, cutting it with sabers. The fortifications were taken. The Whites and Japanese fled.
     
      Sergei Lazo—a hero of the civil war in the Far East. In 1920, Comrade Lazo was burned alive in the firebox of a locomotive by Japanese invaders.
     
      In October 1922, the Red Army liberated Vladivostok.
      The Japanese yoke over the Far East was thrown off.
      But the workers of Siberia and the Far East will long remember the violence and looting perpetrated by the Japanese army. The workers and peasants will never forget how the Japanese burned Red partisans alive in the fireboxes of locomotives. Thus died the hero Sergei Lazo for the liberation of the Far East.
      The creation of the USSR. Now the entire country was cleared of White troops and invaders. It was necessary to protect the country from further armed attacks by bourgeois countries. It was necessary to revive the economy and build socialism. It was necessary to assist all the peoples of the Land of Soviets in raising their national culture. To achieve all this, it was necessary to create a unified union state. To this end, in 1922, at the suggestion of Lenin and Stalin, delegates from the union republics gathered in Moscow for the First All-Union Congress of Soviets and formed a voluntary state association of peoples, a union state called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
      Initially, the USSR united several Soviet republics: the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), with its capital Moscow; the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR), with its capital initially in Kharkov and later in Kiev; and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR), with its capital Minsk. The Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republics—Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia—formed a single union—the Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (TSFSR), with its capital Tbilisi. A little later, three independent Soviet republics were established in Central Asia: Uzbekistan, with its capital in Tashkent; Turkmenistan, with its capital in Ashgabat; and Tajikistan, with its capital in Stalinabad. These republics also became part of the USSR.

      The peoples of the USSR began to live as a close-knit family. Many nationalities, dying out, oppressed, and illiterate under tsarism, were now revived and began to build socialism in a fraternal union of peoples. The development of national culture took rapid strides in all the republics. Many schools, universities, and libraries were opened, theaters were built, and many books began to be printed in national languages. The peoples of the USSR, previously unwritten, received their own alphabet. The culture of the peoples flourished.
     
    </chap><chap>61. Lenin died, but his work lives on
     
      . The Death of Lenin. On January 21, 1924, at the age of 54, after a long and serious illness, the great Lenin died in Gorki, near Moscow. Working people all over the world lost their leader, who prepared and carried out the proletarian revolution, saving it from countless enemies in difficult years. A man greater than anyone had done for humanity died.
      Deepest sorrow gripped millions of working people. In the bitter January frosts, lines of Moscow workers walked to bid farewell to the ashes of their brilliant leader. They were overcome with deep sorrow and a firm resolve to follow the path shown by Lenin.
     
      Moscow workers walk to bid farewell to the ashes of V. I. Lenin in the Column Hall of the House of Unions.
     
      To the sounds of a mournful march, the people buried Lenin at the Kremlin wall. There he lies, as if alive, in a marble mausoleum, in a glass coffin, with the Order of the Red Banner on his chest.
      And workers from all corners of our country, arriving in Moscow, go to the mausoleum to capture the image of the leader who led the people to a free and happy life.

      Stalin's Oath. On January 26, when delegates from all over the USSR gathered for the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets, Stalin, on behalf of the Bolshevik Party, took an oath before the people on behalf of the Party. He said:
      "In leaving us, Comrade Lenin bequeathed to us to hold high and preserve pure the great title of Party member. We swear to you, Comrade Lenin, that we will fulfill this commandment of yours with honor!" ...
      "In leaving us, Comrade Lenin bequeathed to us to guard the unity of our Party as the apple of our eye. We swear to you, Comrade Lenin, that we will also fulfill this commandment of yours with honor!" ...
      "Only in our country did the oppressed and downtrodden masses of working people succeed in throwing off the rule of landowners and capitalists and replacing it with the rule of workers and peasants" ...
      "This gigantic struggle was led by Comrade Lenin and his Party" ...
      "The name of Lenin has become the most beloved name of the working and exploited masses."
      "When Comrade Lenin left us, he bequeathed to us the duty of preserving and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. We swear to you, Comrade Lenin, that we will spare no effort to fulfill this commandment of yours with honor!"
     
      Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (1879–1953).
     
      “When he left us, Comrade Lenin bequeathed to us the task of strengthening the union of workers and peasants with all our might. We swear to you, Comrade Lenin, that we will fulfill this commandment of yours with honor!”…
      “Russians and Ukrainians, Bashkirs and Belarusians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, Armenians and Dagestanis, Tatars and Kyrgyz, Uzbeks and Turkmen—all are equally interested in strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.”…
      “Comrade Lenin tirelessly spoke to us of the need for a voluntary union of the peoples of our country, of the need for their fraternal cooperation within the Union of Republics.”
      “When he left us, Comrade Lenin bequeathed to us the task of strengthening and expanding the Union of Republics. ” We swear to you, Comrade Lenin, that we will fulfill this commandment of yours with honor! ...
      "Lenin repeatedly pointed out to us that strengthening the Red Army and improving its condition is one of the most important tasks of our party" ...
      "Let us swear, comrades, that we will spare no effort to strengthen our Red Army, our Red Navy."
     
      XV. Five-Year Plans of Socialism and the Great Patriotic War
     
    </chap><chap>62. Socialist Industry and Collective Farms in Agriculture (Kolkhozes)
     
      Construction of Socialist Industry. The old factories and plants that were put into operation were very backward and had outdated machinery. There were few of them, and they produced very few goods needed by the country. Little pig iron was smelted. Little oil and coal were mined. Many goods were not produced at all. They had to be imported from abroad.
     
      Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov.
     
      In 1925, at the 14th Party Congress, Comrade Stalin, on the Party's instructions, declared that we must transform our agricultural country into an industrial one in the shortest possible time. To do this, we must build many new factories, plants, and power plants; and refurbish all the old plants in accordance with the latest scientific and technological advances. We must build tractors, combines, automobiles, new machine tools for factories, and airplanes. We must create many well-trained workers and specialists. We must catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries, "otherwise they will crush us." This is called industrialization.
     
      Grigory Konstantinovich Ordzhonikidze (1886–1937).
     
      But this plan for building socialism in our country was opposed by traitors within the party at the time—Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev. They strove by every means to disrupt the construction of socialist industry. They claimed that it was impossible to build a socialist society in the USSR, that workers and peasants could not do without capitalists and kulaks. The foreign bourgeoisie exploited their struggle against the party to slander the Soviet Union and fight it. They bribed some of the old specialists and the remnants of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, creating counterrevolutionary groups of saboteurs to disrupt the USSR's growing industry. The saboteurs sabotaged machinery and caused cave-ins in coal and ore mines. They blew up and burned factories, plants, and power plants. The saboteurs were caught and severely punished. But the Trotskyists continued their struggle against the party and the people. The party expelled the Trotskyists from its ranks. Trotsky was expelled from the Soviet Union by the people, and he openly went into the service of the bourgeoisie.
     
      Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin (1875–1946).
     
      To implement the tasks set for the country by Comrade Stalin, a major project was developed in 1928—the first five-year plan for socialist construction.
      The workers of the Union enthusiastically took up this great construction project, displaying examples of labor heroism. In the Soviet Union, labor became a matter of honor and glory, a matter of valor and heroism. Intense work continued day and night at construction sites.
     
      Blast furnaces of the Kuznetsk Metallurgical Plant.
     
      Socialist competition unfolded in factories, plants, and railways. Construction workers demonstrated achievements in bricklaying, timber felling for construction sites, and building factory buildings unseen anywhere in the world.
      In 1930, on the banks of the Tom River, near the city of Kuznetsk, where the Siberian Tatar khans once held land, construction began on a massive metallurgical plant named after Stalin, which was completed by the end of the first five-year plan.
      Where the Dnieper rapids once stood, on the site of the Zaporizhian Sich, the powerful Dnieper Hydroelectric Station named after Lenin was built.
     
      Valerian Vladimirovich Kuibyshev (1888–1935) was the architect.
     
      With the help of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station's electricity, many regions of Ukraine flourished. The Dnieper River, dotted with rapids, became completely navigable, and many factories around the station began to draw power from it and produce goods needed by the country.
      In 1930, the Turkestan-Siberian Railway was built across the waterless steppes and sands, connecting rich and grain-rich Siberia with flourishing Central Asia.
      During the first five-year plan, especially many factories were built in the national republics. Central Asia, Transcaucasia, Ukraine, and Belarus built dozens of new factories.
      All this made it possible to build a socialist industry, that is, an industry without capitalists.
      Collective farms were built. Tractors, the steel horses of peasant agriculture, were ready. During the first five-year plan, the powerful Dzerzhinsky Tractor Plant in Stalingrad and combine factories in Saratov and Zaporozhye were built.
      All this was necessary to ensure that peasant farming was managed according to the latest scientific and technological advances.
      This made it possible to transform small individual peasant farms into collective farms. This was a difficult task. At first, peasants still clung tightly to their small holdings.
     
      Harvesting with combines on collective farm fields.
     
      The Party managed to demonstrate to the peasants, not only in words but also in deeds, the enormous benefits and advantages of large collective farms over small ones. The Soviet government sent numerous tractors, combines, and other machines to the countryside. And in 1929, a wave of middle-class peasants followed the poor peasants into the collective farms. The kulak, seeing the end of the collective farms, began to furiously resist their organization. The kulaks killed leading collective farmers, damaged collective farm machinery, and burned collective farm grain. The kulak struggle against the collective farms was supported by a tiny group of traitors to the people, led by Bukharin and Rykov. They, like the Trotskyists, opposed the Five-Year Plan.
      But the Bolshevik Party defeated these traitors and helped the peasantry crush kulak resistance and eliminate the kulaks.
      The collective farms grew, gained strength, and began to rapidly advance toward a happy, prosperous life. The peasants on the collective farms began to sow more fields and harvest more grain. There were more schools, libraries, and clubs in the villages. By 1932, more than half of the peasant households had been united into collective farms.
      Socialist agriculture emerged in the Soviet Union—that is, agriculture without landowners or kulaks.
      In 1932, the five-year plan for socialist construction was completed in four years. Workers and peasants could celebrate victory. The USSR, having fulfilled the first five-year plan, ensured the victory of socialism. The USSR now produced cars, mined metal, built tractors and aircraft, and increased coal and oil production. The USSR had become an industrial country.
      It now produced three times more food than Tsarist Russia. By 1933, the USSR had caught up with and surpassed a number of European countries. It ranked second in the world in oil production, second in steel production, third in pig iron production, and fourth in coal production.
      But enemies both within the USSR and abroad hindered the construction of factories in our country. In 1929, foreign capitalists forced China to wage war against the USSR. Troops of Chinese generals and White Guards attacked our Far Eastern borders. But the Red Army in the Far East was strong and resilient, quickly defeating the enemies. There were saboteurs within the country as well. In 1930, a large group of saboteurs, including veteran engineers, Mensheviks, and Socialist Revolutionaries, were rounded up. They wanted capitalists to return to our country and were preparing a new war against the USSR. The saboteurs were caught and severely punished by the Soviet government. After this, workers and peasants further strengthened and armed their Red Army and helped the Chekists expose the enemies of the Soviet people.
      Thus, through labor and battle, the first five-year plan for the great projects outlined by the Bolshevik Party was completed.
     
    </chap><chap>63. The USSR – a Socialist Country.
     
      Cultural Achievements and People of the Socialist Country. During the First Five-Year Plan, the face of our country changed dramatically. During the Second Five-Year Plan (1933–1937), an even more radical restructuring of our entire life took place. On one-sixth of the globe, from the North Pole to the scorching steppes of Turkmenistan, from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, a new, socialist system was created; a new life was created without exploitation and oppression, without capitalists and landowners, without merchants and kulaks.
      The country began to function in a new way. The people of the Land of Soviets discovered the riches hidden in the bowels of the earth. The extraction of coal, oil, gold, platinum, iron ore, and non-ferrous metals reached previously unheard-of levels. In the rich forests of the USSR, people began to harvest a huge variety of wood species. In our oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers, people increased the harvest of marine animals and valuable fish to unprecedented levels. During the Second Five-Year Plan, socialist fields supplied the country with the necessary quantities of grain, cotton, flax, and beets. Increasing quantities of tea, tangerines, lemons, oranges, apples, pears, and grapes were grown in socialist fields and orchards.
      Dozens of giant factories, built using the latest science and technology by Soviet engineers and equipped with Soviet machinery, expanded production and improved their products year after year. Hundreds of new factories were built in industries that had never existed before. Our automobiles, tractors, combines, airplanes, and machine tools for factories and plants are in no way inferior to foreign ones.
      Only the workers and peasants of the USSR, liberated from capitalist exploitation, were able to create such a powerful industry and such a robust agriculture in such a short time. Caring for people—the shortest working hours in the world, high wages, rest homes, sanatoriums, occupational safety at work, good housing, and training in technical and other skills—created an unprecedented rise in labor productivity. Labor ceased to be a yoke.
      New, special people emerged in the Soviet Union.
      In the Donets Basin, coal miner Alexey Stakhanov mined 102 tons of coal in a single shift, more than 14 times the norm.
      At the Gorky automobile plant, blacksmith Busygin forged 1,050 crankshafts in a single shift instead of the standard 675.
      The Vinogradov weavers began working on 144 looms instead of 10. Hundreds and thousands of others followed these pioneering figures, dubbed Stakhanovites. The Stakhanovite movement swept the entire country, spreading from factories to agriculture. Collective farmers began harvesting unprecedented crops. Maria Demchenko achieved a harvest of 500 centners of beets per hectare.

      Tractor drivers from Pasha Angelina's team plow over a thousand hectares with a single tractor each summer.
      Our country needed well-established transportation, and this task was successfully accomplished.
      Canals were dug—the White Sea-Baltic Canal, connecting the Baltic Sea with the White Sea, and the Moscow Canal.
      A marvelously beautiful metro system, the best in the world, was built in the capital of the USSR, Moscow.
      Soviet airplanes paved routes to the previously unknown icy wastes of the Arctic, conquered the North Pole, and established a radio station there. Soviet pilots discovered a previously unknown route across the North Pole from the USSR to America. The names of Soviet polar explorers and pilots—Heroes of the Soviet Union—Schmidt, Chkalov, Baidukov, Belyakov, Gromov, Yumashev, Danilin, Vodopyanov, Molokov, Slepnev, and others—are known throughout the country.

      The Palace of Soviets project in Moscow.
     
      New cities in the USSR grew with incredible speed—Stalinsk in Western Siberia, Magnitogorsk in the Urals, Komsomolsk in the Far East, and others. Old cities were rebuilt and became unrecognizable.
      The capitals of the Soviet republics and major industrial centers especially grew and became more beautiful. Old Moscow, with its crooked streets, was transformed into the glittering capital of the Soviet Union. Hundreds of beautiful buildings were erected in Moscow.
      16-, 26-, and 32-story buildings were built in our capital.
      The Palace of Soviets, with its sculpture of V. I. Lenin at its top, will be one of the most remarkable buildings in the world.
      The capitalist system was a grave for popular talent. Only a few individuals managed to break through to creative and scientific careers. Such was I. V. Michurin, a great horticulturist of our country. He cultivated many new varieties of fruit. They are frost-resistant. Michurin's apple trees blossom and bend under the weight of their fruit in the frigid Siberia and the Far North. His scientific discoveries were appreciated only by the Soviet authorities.
      Another talent—the grandfather of Russian aviation—K.E. Tsiolkovsky designed an airplane 13 years before the first plane took flight. He invented a metal airship several years before the first airship was invented in Germany. However, these inventions were not appreciated in Tsarist Russia. Only in the Soviet Union did Tsiolkovsky's work find application.
      Only under Soviet rule did Academician I.P. Pavlov widely expand his scientific work. Surrounded by the care of the Soviet people and supported by the Soviet government, I.P. Pavlov made many discoveries about human life.
      Our country raised and educated thousands of new scientists from among workers and peasants in its numerous schools and universities.
      Soviet musicians and artists are first-class masters of art. Soviet pianists and violinists have received top awards at international competitions.
      Every schoolchild can become whatever they want. All peoples of the Soviet Union were given the opportunity to study in their native languages.
      No other country in the world publishes as many books or produces as many newspapers as the USSR. Nowhere else are there as many libraries as ours.
     
      Maxim Gorky (1868–1936).
     
      Folk art in the USSR enjoyed the broadest development. Folk talents flourished in theater, literature, and film. Under the Party's leadership, these talents were nurtured and cultivated by the great proletarian writer Maxim Gorky, a personal friend of Lenin and Stalin. Inspired by the construction of socialism in our country, Gorky wrote fiery pages of unforgettable literary works. Together with all the people, Gorky built a happy life in our country.
     
      Sergei Mironovich Kirov (1886–1934).
     
      In 1934, at the 17th Congress of the Bolshevik Party, the great leader of the people, Stalin, said: "Everyone can see that the Party line has won." This means that the path shown by the Bolshevik Party was the right one.
      Millions of workers in the Soviet Union and abroad echoed Stalin's words: "The Party line has won."
      The remnants of the parasitic capitalist and kulak class were destroyed. They will never rise again in the Soviet Union.
      The Party fulfilled Lenin's great legacy. Under its leadership, the people created a new, socialist system. The people strengthened their beloved Motherland.
      Only in a socialist country could such courageous people emerge—people who, loving their homeland, do not hesitate to lay down their lives for it.

      But the USSR is surrounded by countries dominated by capitalists, and therefore spies and saboteurs will not cease trying to infiltrate our country and harm us.
      The eyes of the worker and peasant must be sharper.
      All residents of the Land of Soviets, from the youngest to the oldest, must guard their borders more vigilantly.
      The Soviet Army and our friends beyond the borders of the USSR. The Soviet Union is as strong and robust as any other state in the world. It is strong because of its Soviet Army, armed with the latest technology and science. It is renowned for its marshals and commanders, its heroic soldiers.
      It is even stronger because the entire people, as one, men and women, children, adults and the elderly, will defend their beloved and dear homeland to the last drop of blood.
      The Soviet Union is the socialist fatherland of workers throughout the world, a mighty bulwark of freedom and happiness for all progressive humanity. Advanced workers of all countries sympathize with the USSR and wish it success. The support of these peoples and advanced workers makes the USSR even more powerful.
     
    </chap><chap>64. The New Constitution of the USSR
     
      How our state is built. The Great Proletarian Revolution destroyed and abolished the hated tsarist monarchy and its laws that kept workers and peasants in chains.
      The liberated workers and peasants built their own state on the ruins of old Russia. It was a workers' and peasants' state unprecedented in the world, which they called the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR).
     
      Lazar Moiseevich Kaganovich.
     
      For three years, the Soviet Republic fought off enemies pressing in from all sides. It defeated the landowners and capitalists, Russian and foreign, who had organized a civil war against it. It helped all the oppressed peoples of old Russia throw off the yoke of landowner and capitalist violence. It helped them establish Soviet power on their liberated lands. Soviet republics emerged and were strengthened in Ukraine, Belarus, Central Asia, and Transcaucasia. Through the combined efforts of all these Soviet republics, all enemies were finally defeated. The liberated peoples began to rebuild their war-torn economies. In 1922, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, they created the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The USSR initially included four union republics, later joined by three more.
      Nowhere in the world has there been, or continues to be, such friendship and mutual trust among peoples as in the USSR. In 1924, the free peoples of the USSR adopted the first Constitution of the USSR (the Basic Law of the State). In it, they enshrined the country's victories. Much time has passed since then—industry has been built and expanded enormously, collective and state farms have been established, culture has flourished, the remnants of landowners, capitalists, and kulaks have been uprooted and destroyed, the exploitation of workers and oppression of people have been abolished. But in our country, enemies of the Soviet people, enemies of the USSR, still remained. It was they—the friends of Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev, and with them Rykov and Bukharin—who organized a gang of murderers, saboteurs, and spies in the USSR. It was they who viciously murdered Sergei Mironovich Kirov, a Bolshevik loyal to the people. They also brought about the death of the great Russian writer Maxim Gorky. They assassinated V. V. Kuibyshev and V. R. Menzhinsky.
      Trotskyists and Rykovites did whatever they could: sabotaged machinery in factories and plants, blew up mines and railway bridges, and caused train derailments. They dreamed of destroying state farms, of destroying our powerful collective farm economy. They dreamed of handing over our rich Soviet Ukraine to the Germans and the Far East to the Japanese. They dreamed of war and the military defeat of the USSR. Soviet power mercilessly and promptly eliminated the enemies of the Soviet people. Socialism triumphed in the USSR.
     
      In 1936, a commission led by I. V. Stalin drafted a new Constitution of the USSR. It was submitted for broad public debate and then approved by the highest governing body of the Union—the All-Union Congress of Soviets. The day the Constitution was approved, December 5, was declared a national holiday. The Constitution enshrines the most important achievements of the Soviet Union during its 19 years of existence.
      The previous Constitution stated that our republic was called socialist because the working class held power and strove to build socialism. The new Constitution calls our state a socialist state of workers and peasants because socialism had already been largely built in the USSR.
      In the USSR, all power belongs to the workers of the city and village—the Soviets of Workers' Deputies.
      The land, its mineral wealth, factories, mines, plants, railways, large buildings, and state farms (state farms) are the property of the state and the common property of the people.
      Alongside state ownership, there is cooperative and collective farm ownership, the property of individual collective farms, and cooperative associations.
      The Constitution stipulates that small-scale farming by artisans and individual peasants is also permitted in the USSR, but only on the condition that such artisans or individual peasants work independently and do not exploit the labor of others.
      Our state achieved all this because it abolished the landowners and capitalists, destroyed the kulaks, and abolished the exploitation of man by man.
      In the USSR, all people capable of labor must work. "He who does not work, neither shall he eat."
      The USSR is a voluntary and friendly association of equal peoples. "And this friendship is a great thing: as long as it exists," said Stalin, "the peoples of our country will be free and invincible."
      Currently, the USSR is a voluntary association of 16 equal union republics. The USSR includes:
      the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic,
      the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic,
      the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist
      Republic, the Uzbek Soviet Socialist
      Republic, the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic,
      the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic,
      the Azerbaijan Soviet
      Socialist Republic, the Lithuanian Soviet
      Socialist Republic, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic,
      the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic,
      the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic,
      the Tajik
      Soviet Socialist Republic, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic,
      the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, the
      Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, and
      the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.
     
      The highest body of state power in the USSR is the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Only the Supreme Soviet has the right to issue laws. It forms the government of the USSR — the Council of Ministers of the USSR.
      At the local level, the organs of power everywhere are the councils of workers' deputies. All local councils, as well as the supreme councils of the union and autonomous republics, as well as the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, are elected by citizens of the USSR on the basis of universal, equal, and direct suffrage by secret ballot. All citizens of the USSR, both men and women, who have reached the age of 18, regardless of race, nationality, religion, educational qualifications, social origin, property status, or past activities, have the right to participate in the elections of deputies, with the exception of the insane and individuals convicted by a court with deprivation of voting rights. Citizens who have reached the age of 23 may be elected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Such elections are called universal. All citizens have equal rights in elections. Citizens of our country elect deputies to all bodies of government by personal vote. Such elections are called direct elections.
      Voting in elections is secret; every citizen votes for the person they wish to elect to the council.
      Citizens of the USSR have the right to work, rest, education, and financial security in old age. These rights are guaranteed by our state. In a socialist country, there is no unemployment, which affects millions of workers in capitalist countries.
      Thousands of rest homes and sanatoriums are open to workers. Every year, all workers and employees of the USSR are granted vacation.
      In the USSR, all workers can study and receive an education. The state provides scholarships to many students.
      In the USSR, every person is cared for from birth to old age. Nurseries and kindergartens are organized for children. The elderly and sick are provided with state assistance. All citizens of the USSR are guaranteed freedom of speech, press, assembly, and street demonstrations.
      But in addition to rights, every citizen of the USSR also has responsibilities to the state. All citizens are obliged to strictly comply with the laws of the Soviet Union, maintain discipline, work honestly, and protect and strengthen socialist property. Anyone who encroaches on socialist property is an enemy of the peoples of the USSR.
      Defending the Fatherland from any and all enemies of the USSR is the highest duty of a citizen of the USSR. If anyone goes over to the enemy's side or reveals the USSR's military secrets to the enemy, he will betray his homeland, his people, and will be punished as an enemy of the USSR.
     
    </chap><chap>65. New Soviet Republics
     
      The reunification of Western Ukraine with the Ukrainian SSR and Western Belarus with the Byelorussian SSR. The USSR was building a peaceful life. Meanwhile, a new world war was being prepared in Western Europe. The fascists had seized power in Germany. They were the worst enemies of the working people. The leader of the fascists, Hitler, wanted to subjugate the entire world. He said that all peoples should work for the Germans and be their slaves. Above all, he wanted to turn all Slavs into slaves: Czechoslovakians, Poles, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Russians, and others.
      In 1938, Germany started World War II. It captured Czechoslovakia and a year later attacked Poland. The reckless Polish government was unprepared for war. The Polish army was easily defeated. Poland's rulers fled, abandoning their country to the mercy of the enemy.
      The lands of Western Belarus and Western Ukraine were under Polish control. A terrible enemy was approaching. Ukrainians and Belarusians were facing disaster. Then, on September 17, 1939, Soviet troops entered Western Ukraine and Western Belarus and took their populations under their protection. The fascist bandits stopped and advanced no further.
      Ukrainians and Belarusians joyfully greeted their saviors—the Soviet soldiers. Flowers were strewn along the path of our tanks. The peoples of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus unanimously expressed their desire to join the Soviet Union and reunite with Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Belarus. Thus, the close-knit family of Soviet peoples was replenished.
      The formation of new Soviet republics. The German conquest of Poland caused alarm in neighboring states—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. They were threatened with Nazi enslavement. The peoples of these countries looked to the Soviet Union with hope. In 1940, they proclaimed Soviet sovereignty and declared their desire to join the USSR. Thus, three more new union republics were formed. Thus, the borders of our homeland moved to the shores of the Baltic Sea. This strengthened the Soviet Union even further.
      At the same time, our government entered into negotiations with Romania. During the Civil War, Romania had seized Soviet Bessarabia. Large Romanian landowners—the boyars—cruelly oppressed its population. The people of Bessarabia and neighboring Bukovina continued their struggle for freedom. Romanian prisons were overflowing with liberation fighters. The Soviet government demanded that Romania liberate Bessarabia and Bukovina, and the issue of these lands was peacefully resolved. Bessarabia and Bukovina became Soviet. Bessarabia united with Soviet Moldova, creating the Moldavian SSR.
      A terrible threat loomed over Leningrad. This great city was located right next to the border with Finland. The fascists dominated Finland. They dreamed of capturing Leningrad and other Soviet lands and started a war against us. The armed forces of the USSR broke through the impregnable Finnish fortifications and dealt the Finns a crushing blow. The border was pushed back from Leningrad. Part of the liberated lands was united with Soviet Karelia to form the Karelo-Finnish SSR.
      Thus, in 1939 and 1940, the Soviet Union grew, strengthened, expanded, and fortified its western borders. The USSR stood firm, like an impregnable fortress. Comrade Stalin said: "We do not want war, but we are ready to respond blow for blow from the warmongers."
     
    </chap><chap>66. The Great Patriotic War
     
      . The enemy's attack. Meanwhile, the world war escalated. Nazi Germany captured Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Yugoslavia, and Greece. It was assisted by Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland. France and England opposed Germany, and then the United States of America joined them. France was led by traitors. They fought the fascists in words, but in reality they aided them. The French army was betrayed, and the Germans, having easily defeated it, took control of all of France. Almost all of Europe fell under the control of Hitler.
      The Soviet Union was against the war and constantly fought for peace. Therefore, our government concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany. According to this pact, Nazi Germany could not attack us. But the Nazis did not keep their word. They concentrated a large army on our border and treacherously attacked the USSR. This was on June 22, 1941. Thousands of German tanks devastated our land, thousands of Nazi planes dropped bombs on our peaceful cities. Having broken into our country, the enemy drenched it in blood.
      The attack was sudden. Soviet people worked peacefully. It took time to mobilize them into the army. Moreover, we had fewer tanks, planes, and guns than the Germans, since the Nazis had equipment from almost all of Europe. Therefore, our units retreated in battle, while the enemy advanced and rushed towards Moscow and Leningrad. Hitler boasted that the Soviet armed forces had been defeated and that within weeks the entire Soviet Union would be conquered.
     
      The Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Generalissimo Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (1879–1953),
     
      was the commander-in-chief. But at the head of our homeland stood Comrade Stalin. He knew the strength of the Soviet people and was confident of our victory. Comrade Stalin inspired everyone to fight the cruel enemy. He called for a concerted effort to defeat the invaders, to defend every inch of Soviet soil, to fight to the last drop of blood. He called for increased work in the rear to provide the army with everything it needed. He called for the creation of partisan detachments in enemy-held areas, to attack and kill the fascists, to blow up bridges and roads, to derail trains, to disrupt telephone and telegraph communications, to set fire to forests, warehouses, and supply trains, and to leave nothing for the enemy.
      At Comrade Stalin's call, all Soviet peoples rose as one to fight for their homeland. Everyone understood that this was the Great Patriotic War, a war for the liberation and independence of our beloved homeland. Everyone knew: if we win, we will be free, but if we are defeated, we will become slaves to the German princes and barons.
      The workers of Moscow and Leningrad prepared for defense. Many old men and women took up arms and joined the militia. Thousands of Muscovites and Leningraders dug trenches and anti-tank ditches, built fortifications, and extinguished fires ignited by enemy bombs.
      The Soviet Army displayed miracles of heroism near Moscow and Leningrad. For example, on the approaches to Moscow, 28 guardsmen from General Panfilov's division withstood an onslaught of 50 German tanks. They cried, "There is nowhere further to retreat. Moscow is behind us." They knew they would perish in an unequal battle, but they didn't waver, fighting to their last breath and holding off the tanks for four hours, destroying 14 of them. The entire nation fought with such courage.
      By the beginning of winter 1941, the enemy had not only been held back but also driven back from Moscow.
      The Germans still had plenty of strength. Having suffered defeats near Moscow and Leningrad, they launched an offensive in the south in the summer of 1942. The Nazis were pushing east. Devastating Soviet lands, they invaded the fertile steppes of the Northern Caucasus, approached the Volga near Stalingrad, and stopped on the Don near Voronezh.
      The Germans wanted to outflank Moscow and cut it off from the Urals and Siberia. The danger was great. Our homeland strained every nerve to fight.
      In areas captured by the enemy. Capturing Soviet lands, the Nazis devastated them. They stole grain, livestock, and various foodstuffs from the population. They destroyed libraries, schools, and museums. They took everything of value for themselves and took it to Germany. Soviet people were forced to work for the Germans. Thousands of men, women, and girls were deported to Germany and sold into slavery to German landowners and kulaks.
      The Nazis tortured and executed people for the slightest resistance. Gallows were erected in town and village squares.
      But no amount of persecution could intimidate the Soviet people. To fight the invaders, partisan detachments were formed everywhere. The partisans carried out Comrade Stalin's orders: they attacked Nazi garrisons, blew up bridges, and derailed trains. When captured by the enemy, the partisans steadfastly endured excruciating torture, never revealing anything the enemy wanted to know. Thus, Soviet girls died heroically—Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Liza Chaikina, pioneer Sasha Chekalin, and many others. But hundreds of thousands of Nazis were killed by the partisans
      in the Soviet rear. At the same time, our homeland had become a single military camp. Men went to the front. Women and the elderly replaced those who had left in the rear. Collective farmers provided the country with bread, food, and raw materials for industry. Workers worked day and night. Many new factories were built. The country produced more and more tanks, planes, guns, mortars, and shells. Trains ran continuously along the railways to the west, delivering everything necessary to the front. Our tanks, planes, and guns proved superior to the Germans. And soon, we outstripped the Nazis in terms of weaponry.
      Heroes of the front. Soviet people selflessly and heroically fought against the enemy.
      Captain Gastello's plane caught fire in battle. The pilot could have parachuted, but he didn't. Gastello flew the flaming plane into a column of enemy gasoline vehicles and blew them up.
      Brave Russian pilots Zdorovtsev and Kharitonov expended all their ammunition in aerial combat. But they didn't want to lose the enemy and aimed their planes at their bombers. The German planes were rammed, and our heroic pilots remained unharmed.
      Soldier Matrosov was advancing with his unit. A machine gun was firing from a Nazi fortification. Matrosov rushed to it and shielded it with his body. The machine gun failed to fire, and our forces broke through the enemy defenses.
      Azerbaijani Gusein Aliyev single-handedly engaged several Nazi aircraft. Seventeen wounds covered his body, but he shot down the enemy and emerged victorious.
      A brave fighter from Kazakhstan, Torupsabayev, was advancing on the attack. A German gunshot struck his platoon commander. Confusion ensued. Then Torupsabayev ran forward and shouted, "For the Motherland!" He led his platoon against the Germans. The enemy wavered, and when the battle ended, Torupsabayev simply said, "My job is small—to defeat the Germans. But together, we are a great force."
      Thus, the workers and peasants, all the peoples of the Soviet Union, rose up in unison, both at the rear and at the front, to fight the hated enemy.
      The Nazi invaders were routed. In the autumn of 1942, the Germans were held back near Stalingrad. Every day, they rained thousands of bombs on the city, pounding it with heavy artillery. The city was reduced to rubble, but it did not surrender. Here, Comrade Stalin prepared a crushing blow for the enemy.
      In November, the Soviet Army launched an offensive at Stalingrad. At the appointed hour, Soviet artillery thundered, tanks advanced, and infantry charged. The great Battle of Stalingrad had begun. The German front was broken. 300,000 fascist soldiers were encircled and routed. The invaders were driven from the Volga, Don, and the North Caucasus. Thus began the liberation of our lands.
      It was not easy to drive back the brutal enemy. He fought back furiously, but was routed in a series of major battles: at Kursk, Leningrad, on the Dnieper, in Crimea, in Belarus, in Bessarabia, and in the Baltics. In all these battles, many German divisions were destroyed or disabled.
      Withdrawing from Soviet soil, the vicious enemy sought to destroy everything. As they retreated, the Nazis burned villages and towns. They killed thousands of Soviet people—even children were spared. They took everything of value with them.
      In the summer of 1944, all Soviet soil was cleared of the invaders. Victory salutes thundered joyfully in Moscow.
      The unity of freedom-loving peoples. The Soviet Army extended military operations beyond our homeland's borders and soon decisively defeated Germany's allies—Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, and Hungary. Our troops entered their lands. All these states admitted defeat. Their peoples expelled their rulers and, together with the Soviet Army, began the war against Nazi Germany. Dealing blow after blow to the Germans, our army liberated Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The peoples enslaved by the Nazis greeted their liberator with gratitude. They saw and understood that the Soviet Union was their best friend.
      The friendship between all freedom-loving peoples grew stronger with each passing day.
      The Soviet Union bore the brunt of the war.
      For three years of war, England and the United States of America delayed opening a second front in Europe against German troops by every means possible. But when, after the Soviet Army's enormous victories, it became clear that the Soviet Union alone could completely defeat the enemy, occupy German territory, and liberate all of Western Europe, including France, England and the United States opened a second front in Europe. In June 1944, British and American troops crossed the sea from England and landed on the coast of northern France.
      Victory over Nazi Germany. In January 1945, the Soviet Army entered Germany. Generalissimo of the Soviet Union Comrade Stalin called for "pursuing the wounded German beast on the heels and finishing it off in its own lair." German fortifications were breached, fortresses destroyed.
      Soviet troops surrounded large groups of German troops and, if they did not surrender, they were destroyed. The valiant Soviet troops advanced rapidly, crushing the enemy on its own territory. Our victorious banners fluttered over enemy territory.
      By April 21, 1945, our soldiers had already reached Berlin and engaged in battle on its outskirts. A few days later, Berlin was surrounded on all sides, and on May 2, it was captured by troops of the 1st Ukrainian and 1st Belorussian Fronts. The capture of the German capital was the most powerful blow to Germany, followed by its defeat. On May 8, Nazi Germany capitulated (surrendered to the mercy of the victor). The entire Soviet Union, as well as other countries that had fought against Germany, celebrated the victory over the fascist beast.
      The Soviet government declared May 9 Victory Day, a day of national celebration for the Soviet people.
      Thus, Hitler's wild ideas to enslave the Slavic peoples were not destined to come true. The centuries-long struggle of the Slavic peoples for their existence and independence ended in victory over the German invaders.

      The defeat of Japan. Japan was Germany's ally in the Far East. The Japanese invaders sought to enslave China and other countries. They also repeatedly attacked our homeland.
      To ensure our country's security not only in the West but also in the East, to shorten the end of the war, and to facilitate the speedy restoration of world peace, the Soviet Union entered the war against the Japanese invaders. On September 2, 1945, under the crushing blows of the Soviet Army, Japan admitted defeat and laid down its arms.

      The exploits of the Soviet people, and above all the Russian people, the most outstanding of all the nations comprising the Soviet Union, won victory for our country. Thanks to the heroic efforts of the front and rear, the Soviet people, led by their great commander, Comrade Stalin, managed to defeat the enemy and save the homeland from enslavement.

      As a result of the Great Patriotic War, our homeland grew even stronger, its influence and authority increased among all countries of the world.
      In October 1952, the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union convened in Moscow. The congress adopted a new five-year plan for 1951–1955.
      This plan outlined a new, powerful upsurge in the country's entire national economy.
      On March 5, 1953, the Soviet people and workers around the world suffered a grave, irreparable loss. Stalin, Lenin's disciple and successor, died at the age of 73.
      The death of I. V. Stalin, who dedicated his entire life to serving the people, was a profound loss. The bright memory of I. V. Stalin will live forever in the hearts of working people throughout the world.
      After the death of I. V. Stalin, our people rallied even more closely around the Communist Party and the Soviet government.
      All the efforts of the Soviet people are focused primarily on the development of heavy industry. In our country, the production of metal, machinery, and electricity increases every year, while coal and oil production grows.
      The growth of heavy industry helps develop agriculture, light industry, and the food industry, strengthening our country's defense.
      The Communist Party and the Soviet government are constantly committed to improving the lives of our people.

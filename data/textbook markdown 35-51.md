35. Decembrists
     
      Secret societies of noble revolutionaries. **Alexander I** kept a huge army under arms. The troops located closer to the **European border** were transferred to live in special military settlements, where they performed military service and, while cultivating the land, supported themselves. The head of these settlements was the cruel and rude **General Arakcheev**.
      The already difficult life of soldiers who served in the army for 25 years became worse than hard labor. They spent the whole day at work in the field, then at a military exercise. They even married them according to the choice of the officers. For the slightest offense, soldiers and peasants were mercilessly beaten with sticks, often to death.
      This arbitrariness of the tsar and the **serfdom** greatly outraged the advanced people of the nobles. Many of them served as officers. On campaigns abroad, in **France**, they saw that without serfdom, peasants lived better, that wage labor on estates and factories was more profitable than serfdom. They saw that in the cities of Western Europe people live richer and more cultured than in Russia.
      These nobles dreamed of the same life in their homeland. They organized secret revolutionary societies: «Northern Society» and «Southern Society».
      Members «of the Northern Society» wanted to destroy serfdom, that is, the power of nobles over peasants, but they decided to leave almost all the land to the landowners. They considered it necessary to preserve the king and only recognized it as necessary to limit his power. In this society, the main leaders were the poet and friend of **Pushkin Ryleev** and officers — **Trubetskoy** and **Kakhovsky**.
      In **Ukraine**, in the tsarist troops, the «Southern Society» arose, led by the educated and brave **Colonel Pestel**. He believed that it was necessary to give the peasants not only freedom, but also land. Pestel wanted Russia to have a republic. He offered to kill the king and his family.
      But the members of these secret societies were nobles and were afraid to call the people to revolt. They remembered the peasant uprising against the nobles under **Catherine II**. They wanted to make a revolution only with the help of the troops they commanded.
      Rebellion of the Decembrists. In 1825, Alexander I died. He had no children. His brother Nicholas was to reign.
      On the morning of December 14, 1825, officers — members of the «Northern Society» in **St. Petersburg** brought their regiments to the square in front of the Senate and refused to take the oath to **Tsar Nicholas I**. They were joined by guards sailors. The rebels were awaiting the order of their chief leader, **Prince Trubetskoy**. But he chickened out and did not appear in the square; the uprising was left without leadership. Nicholas summoned the troops loyal to him and surrounded the rebel regiments with them.
      Serfs, artisans, and construction workers gathered near the rebels. They threw logs and stones at the soldiers who remained on Nicholas’ side. But even here the revolutionary nobles were afraid to take advantage of their help.
     
      December 14, 1825 in St. Petersburg. Nicholas I ordered cannons to be fired at the rebels.
     
      Nicholas sent a **governor** to the rebels for negotiations. Officer Kakhovsky killed the governor. Nicholas I was not confident in his troops and for a long time did not dare to act by force. Only in the evening, when artillery was brought up, did he order cannons to be fired at the rebels. Shots rang out. The rebels and the people fled. Hundreds of dead and wounded remained in the square.
      Two weeks later in Ukraine near **Kyiv**, officers from the «Southern Society» rebelled in the **Chernigov regiment**. They led their regiment to join other troops that were in the organization. The troops sent by Nicholas I to suppress the uprising defeated this regiment.
      Having suppressed the uprising, Nicholas I arrested its participants and brutally dealt with them. Five main leaders (Pestel, Ryleev, Kakhovsky, **Muravyov-Apostol** and **Bestuzhev-Ryumin**) were hanged. More than 100 conspiratorial officers were exiled to Siberia. Hundreds of soldiers were driven «through the formation» (they gave each several hundred blows with sticks), many were exiled to hard labor and to the active army in the **Caucasus**.
      The revolutionary nobles who rebelled in December 1825 began to be called Decembrists. There were few of them, and they were not associated with the people. But the Decembrists were the first to take up arms in an organized and open manner against the autocracy in the royal capital itself. Their case did not perish. It was continued by the following generations of revolutionaries.
     
      P. AND. Pestel, K. F. Ryleev, M. P. Bestuzhev-Ryumin, S. AND. Muravyov-Apostol, P. G. Kakhovsky — five Decembrists executed by Nicholas I.
     
      Nicholas I, having become tsar, considered the main task to be the fight against the revolution and in every possible way protected the old, serfdom.
     
36. In the kingdom of gendarmes and officials
     
      Nicholas I. About Tsar Nicholas I, when he was a boy, his teacher said: «I never saw a book in his hands: his only occupation — front and soldiers». Such a man became the Emperor of Russia.
      Nicholas I was very frightened by the uprising of December 14, 1825. To fight the revolution, he created a special police — gendarmes. The chief of the gendarmes was subordinate only to the king himself.
      The entire population was closely monitored. **Gendarmes** and secret police agents scoured the entire state. They eavesdropped on all the rumors among the people and private conversations. At the slightest suspicion, based on an unverified denunciation, people were arrested.
      Nicholas I ruled Russia through noble officials, among whom were many bribe-takers and embezzlers. Officials in institutions and courts extorted bribes from the population, abused and raped people.
      Nicholas I established cruel stick discipline in Russia. In front of him, soldiers and peasants who were arrested were beaten, everyone who went against the landowners and the hover was beaten. They beat me with rods, whips, whips, and sticks.
      The peasants were forced to work even harder for the landowner. All their land was taken away from them, corvee and quitrent were increased.
      The peasants could not withstand such a hard labor life and rebelled against the arbitrariness of the serfs. They killed the most cruel landowners, set fire to and destroyed their estates, refused to work in corvee and pay rent. The unrest among the peasants continued.
      The tsarist troops and police mercilessly suppressed the dissatisfied peasants and dealt with them harshly.
      Living in Tsarist Russia was unbearably difficult.
      Great Russian writers. The great Ukrainian poet **Shevchenko**. Under Nicholas I lived the brilliant Russian poet **Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin**. He wrote beautiful works («**Eugene Onegin**», «**Boris Godunov**». «**The captain's daughter**» and many others), of whom we are still proud. Pushkin created Russian literature.
      Pushkin was born in 1799 in Moscow, into a noble family. While still a boy, he began writing poems. After graduating from the noble school — **lyceum in Tsarskoe Selo** (now the city of Pushkin near Leningrad), he became a famous writer and became close to the Decembrists. In his poems, he sharply condemned serfdom and autocracy. It was impossible to print such poems; they were copied by hand, read secretly and distributed everywhere.
     
      Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799–1837).
     
      Tsar Alexander I learned about these poems, and Pushkin was exiled first to the south, and then to his village for two years. Until the end of his life, Pushkin was under the constant supervision of gendarmes. Life was especially difficult for him under Nicholas I, who knew about Pushkin’s close relationship with the Decembrists. Pushkin's works were published only when Nicholas I himself allowed it.
      The Tsar hated Pushkin. The court nobility poisoned and insulted the great poet. Nicholas I knew well about this persecution and did not take any measures even when it came to the duel. Pushkin fought a duel with one of his offenders and was killed by him in early 1837.
      There was no place for free thought in the kingdom of the gendarmes. Nicholas I exiled another famous poet — **Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov** to the active army in the Caucasus. The Tsar sent him under the bullets of the highlanders because the poet branded Pushkin’s murderers — court parasites in his poem. In the Caucasus, Lermontov was killed in a duel by one slacker officer. Having learned about this, Nicholas I said: «To a dog — dog death».
      The third largest writer of that time — **Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol** described the dominance and arbitrariness of the officials of Nicholas I. His wonderful works «Dead Souls» and «The Inspector General» depict the hard life of serfdom in Russia vividly and truthfully.
      Under Nicholas I, the famous Russian literary critic-revolutionary **Vissarion Grigorievich Belinsky**, hunted down by gendarmes and suffering from tuberculosis, died.
     
      Vissarion Grigorievich Belinsky (1811–1848).
     
      Life was hard in Nikolaev Russia for the largest Russian composer M. AND. Glinka. **Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka** composed the first national Russian opera «**Ruslan and Lyudmila**». In it, he conveyed the music of folk songs not only of the Russian people, but also of other peoples of Russia. The nobles did not understand the beauty of this wonderful work, and Glinka’s opera soon stopped being shown in theaters. Outraged, Glinka left Russia. He died abroad.
      Nicholas I also brutally dealt with the Ukrainian revolutionary poet and artist **Taras Grigorievich Shevchenko**. Shevchenko was initially a serf and bought his way free.
     
      Taras Grigorievich Shevchenko (1814–1861).
     
      In his poems, he wrote about the oppression of the Ukrainian and other peoples of Tsarist Russia, about the hard life of serfs, about the autocracy of tsars and lords and the lack of rights of the people.
      Nicholas I gave Shevchenko as a soldier and exiled him to **Kazakhstan**, forbidding the poet to even write and draw. For ten years they tortured Shevchenko in a soldier’s barracks, but did not break his spirit. He continued to secretly write poetry. They were published in full in Ukraine only under Soviet rule in a collection of his poems «**Kobzar**».
     
37. Accession of the Caucasus
     
      Accession of **Azerbaijan** and **Armenia**. At the beginning of the 19th century, **Georgia** joined Russia. Soon after this, the annexation of Azerbaijan and Armenia, which had suffered under the yoke of **Iran**ian rulers for hundreds of years, to Russia was completed. The **Shah of Iran** has repeatedly tried to seize these lands again. However, Russian troops defeated Iranian troops every time.
      In addition to Iran, Georgia and Armenia were often attacked by **Turkey**. Turkish troops destroyed cities and villages, stole livestock, devastated fields, slaughtered the population of entire cities, and took thousands of inhabitants into slavery.
      After the annexation of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia to Russia, Turkey's predatory attacks began to receive a decisive rebuff. Türkiye now could not ruin Georgians, Armenians, and Azerbaijanis with impunity. Then the **Turkish Sultan** decided to raise small backward tribes of** highlanders** to war against Russia. Highland tribes lived in the high, inaccessible mountains of the Caucasus. These mountains hampered Russia's relations with Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Very few roads passed through the mountains. If the mountaineers had waged war against Russia, it would have been easier for Turkey to attack **Transcaucasia** again.
      Highlander movement under **Shamil**. The fragmented tribes of the highlanders were under the rule of different princes and landowners. One of the rich highlanders, Shamil, declared himself the ruler of all tribes. He began to incite Muslims against the Russians and recruit backward highlanders into his units. Shamil relied on landowners and princes who hated Russia. The Turkish Sultan bribed Shamil, he gave him money, weapons and promised help with troops. **England** also helped Shamil. She sought to weaken Russia and take over the Caucasus. England was already in those years a cruel oppressor of many millions of people in **Asia**, **Africa** and other countries. Capturing the Caucasus by England or Turkey would be a huge misfortune for the peoples of the Caucasus.
      Shamil's troops constantly attacked **Kuban villages** and Georgian villages. Shamil captured many peasants during raids. He put them to death or made them slaves. Shamil's raids especially intensified when Russia's war with Turkey, England and France began in 1853. It was difficult for Russian troops to fight Shamil’s troops, who, after raids, hid in impregnable gorges, in the dense thickets of mountain forests. According to Russian troops, Shamil’s troops still defeated Shamil’s troops.
      The defeat of Shamil and the final annexation of the Caucasus. At first, Shamil managed to deceive the masses of the mountaineers by allegedly waging a war of liberation for independence. But then the people realized this deception. He saw that this war brought him only suffering and ruin. The highlanders also did not want to be under Turkish and English rule. The advanced people of the Caucasus sought unification with Russia.
      The masses of the people were unhappy that Shamil and the officials appointed by him established brutal power over the mountaineers and ruined them. Shamil wanted to force the highlanders to continue the war against Russia with mass executions. He exterminated entire villages of dissatisfied mountaineers. But the people did not submit to Shamil. Shamil's troops began to thin out. On a high mountain in the village of **Gunib (Dagestan)**, Shamil was surrounded by Russian troops and captured. Soon after this, the Caucasus was finally annexed to Russia. The peoples of the Caucasus received security from external enemies.
      The tsarist government, having defeated Shamil, did not save the mountaineers of the Caucasus from the oppression of local landowners. In addition, the king established the power of his officials here.
      However, the annexation of the peoples of the Caucasus to Russia helped them come closer to the Russian people. They got acquainted with advanced Russian culture. Subsequently, the peoples of the Caucasus, together with the Russian people, fought against the tsar, landowners and capitalists.
     
38. Revolution of 1848 in Europe. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
     
      Revolution of 1848 and Nicholas I. By the middle of the 19th century, industry in Europe had already developed greatly. Large industrial centers arose in a number of countries, there were many factories and factories with new machines, and railways were quickly built. Manufacturers and breeders received huge profits. Rich millionaires appeared. Power and power in the state were in their hands.
      The growing industry required more and more workers. A large working class was formed, which did not exist before, — the **proletariat**. He began an open struggle with the capitalists for his rights. The Parisian proletariat became especially famous in the revolution of 1848.
      On February 22, 1848, a revolution broke out in **Paris**, which quickly spread to the cities of France. The **king** fled abroad. A **bourgeois republic** was declared in France.
      But the revolution in France did not bring any relief to the workers. At the end of June 1848, the Parisian proletariat opposed its capitalist masters and the bourgeois republican government. For three days the workers fought heroically. Their wives and children made lead bullets, helped build barricades, and carried a letter to the soldiers under the bullets of soldiers. The bourgeoisie moved well-armed troops against the workers. The workers were poorly organized, lacked weapons, lacked support from the peasants, and the rebellion was crushed. The bourgeoisie brutally dealt with the vanquished: thousands of people were shot, thrown into prison and exiled to hard labor. The bourgeoisie triumphed in victory.
     
      June uprising of Parisian workers in 1848.
     
      At the first news of the revolution in Paris and the unrest in **Prussia** and **Austria**, Nicholas I moved his army to the border of Prussia and Austria. He waited for the moment to strangle the revolutionary movement he hated with his troops.
      Following France, the revolution broke out in many European countries. In the Austrian capital**Vienna**, rebel workers, students and other townspeople overthrew the power of the nobles. The emperor fled Vienna.
      In **Berlin**, revolutionary workers fought on the barricades for 18 hours and forced the **king** to give in. A new government was formed in Prussia, serfdom was destroyed.
      Workers and townspeople rebelled against kings, nobles and partly capitalists in other European countries.
      The revolution covered part of the Austrian Empire — Hungary, and Nicholas I, at the request of the **Emperor of Austria**, sent his troops there and suppressed the revolution.
      This is how Tsar Nicholas I — Gendarme of Europe fought the revolution.
      But no forces could strangle the young class — proletariat that had risen in the revolution of 1848.
      Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The brilliant teachers and leaders of the proletariat were Marx and Engels.
      In 1848 they acted as leaders of revolutionary workers in Germany. **Marx** was then 30 years old, and his friend **Engels** was — 28 years old. They were the first **communist** revolutionaries and even before the revolution they founded «**the Union of Communists**» and wrote the famous «**Communist Manifesto**». In this manifesto, they called on workers around the world to fight their enemies — **capitalists**. Since then, their call «**Proletarians of all countries, unite!**» — has become the banner of workers all over the world.
     
      Karl Marx (1818–1883).
     
      Friedrich Engels (1820–1895).
     
      After the defeat of the revolution in **Germany**. Marx and Engels were forced to leave Germany and settled in England. They had to live and work in difficult conditions. Marx's family was in great need. Engels helped his friend as much as he could and shared failures and joys with him.
      A hard life did not break the great revolutionaries. They tirelessly continued the great work they had begun to free the working people from the oppression of the capitalists.
      They wrote many books from which workers learned how to fight capitalists and how to defeat them.
      Marx and Engels taught the workers that there was always a fierce struggle between the oppressed and the oppressors. Under capitalism, such a struggle is inevitable between the bourgeoisie and the workers, and it must end in victory for the working class. The working class will overthrow the power of the bourgeoisie and establish its revolutionary power — the dictatorship of the proletariat. The victorious proletariat will build a new — communist society in which there will be neither classes nor oppression of people.
      Marx and Engels called on the workers of all countries to unite into a single powerful communist party.
     
39. Tsarist Russia before the reform of 1861
     
      Industrial development. Until the middle of the 19th century, industry in serf Russia developed slowly. Only one tenth of the state's total population lived in cities. Only 500 thousand workers worked in factories and factories. Among them were many serfs who were released by landowners for rent and worked in factories for hire. Factories have just started starting cars and steam engines. Only the first steamships appeared on the **Volga** and **Dnieper**. Only one large railway was built — between Moscow and St. Petersburg.
      Manufacturers and breeders could not build many factories and factories, since there were few free people who could become hired workers. In addition, it was difficult to sell goods in Russia; serfs bought few of them.
      The increase in population in cities and the growth in the number of factories and factories intensified the domestic trade in bread in Russia. Landowners brought a lot of Russian bread abroad, especially to industrial England. They wanted to have more bread to sell and began to oppress the serfs even more.
      It became clear to many landowners that serfdom was hindering the development of the landowner's economy, that hired workers worked the land better and that maintaining them was cheaper. They started talking about the need to destroy serfdom.
      Crimean War. In order to be a complete master on the shores of the **Black Sea**, in order to finally oust the Turks from the Caucasian lands and freely transport landowner bread through the straits to Europe, Nicholas I in 1853 started a new war with Turkey, which had weakened by that time. But England and France did not want Russia to strengthen itself and defeat Turkey. They entered into an alliance with each other and declared war on Nicholas I.
      The Allied fleet entered the Black Sea. Their warships had steam engines and strong artillery, while Nicholas I had only a sailing fleet. The enemy landed a large army in **Crimea** and besieged **Sevastopol**. The enemy was armed with cannons and guns that fired twice as far as the Russians. Such was the military equipment of backward, serf Russia. The tsarist generals did not even have a good map of Crimea. The supply of the army was in the hands of bribe-takers and embezzlers.
      The sea fortress of Sevastopol did not have fortifications from land. In a short time, the population and troops poured earthworks and installed batteries on the hills. The sailing fleet of Nicholas I could not engage the enemy fleet. The Russians sank their ships at the entrance to Sevastopol harbor — the enemy fleet could no longer enter it.
      The siege of Sevastopol lasted 11 months. The defense of Sevastopol was led by **Admiral Nakhimov**. Russian soldiers fought heroically, stubbornly defending the city. Finally, the main fortification — **Malakhov Kurgan**, which was called the door to Sevastopol, was taken by the French after brutal shelling.
      Sevastopol was completely destroyed. It became impossible to stay in it anymore. The garrison left the ruins of the fortress. The defeat of Nikolaev Russia was complete. Nicholas I died unexpectedly during the siege of Sevastopol. **Alexander II** became king.
      In 1856, peace was concluded in Paris. Russia was prohibited from having a navy and fortresses on the Black Sea. But Sevastopol remained with Russia.
      Russia's defeat in the Crimean War showed the extreme backwardness of serf Russia.
      After the war, peasant unrest began throughout the country, and Tsar Alexander II declared at a meeting of nobles: it is better to free the peasants «from above» than to wait until they rise up and liberate themselves «from below».
      A. AND. Herzen. The writer and democrat **Alexander Ivanovich Herzen** resolutely opposed serfdom and tsarist tyranny.
     
      Alexander Ivanovich Herzen (1812–1870).
     
      Nicholas I expelled Herzen from the capital. After returning from exile, Herzen went abroad. Here, together with his friend **Ogarev**, Herzen, already during the reign of Alexander II, began publishing a magazine «**Bell**» in the first free Russian printing house in London. In the magazine, he ardently defended the cause of liberation of the peasantry and oppressed peoples. For reading «The Bells», which was secretly brought to Russia, people were arrested and exiled to Siberia.
     
IX. The rise of capitalism in Tsarist Russia
     
40. Abolition of serfdom in Russia
     
      Manifesto of Alexander II on February 19, 1861. Tsar Alexander II, fearing that the peasants would rise up and defeat the serfdom from below, signed a manifesto on the liberation of the peasants on February 19, 1861. Peasants were declared free, they could not be sold or bought, they ceased to be the property of nobles.
      But the peasants were left with little land — less than they had before the reform. They were given bad land, the landowners took the best land for themselves. The landowners cut off the lands the peasants needed, such as forests, meadows, and pastures. The landowners divided the land so that the landowners' fields separated the peasants' lands from the roads to the watering hole, to the forest, to the pasture. The peasants were forced to ask the landowners to give them the opportunity to use plots of landowner land on any terms they wanted.
      The peasants were forced to pay a ransom to the landowners for their land and liberation, and the land was valued at twice, three times more than it cost. For more than forty years, the peasants paid the landowners about two billion rubles in ransom for their liberation.
      The tsar and landowners robbed the peasants even more in Crimea, Ukraine and the Caucasus. In Crimea, they took for themselves all the best lands on the Black Sea coast. Here were the palaces and estates of the king, the royal family and the court nobility, who kept all the land for themselves. Peasants in Ukraine also received very little land. The landowners did not want to give them fertile black soil. In Georgia, peasants, in addition to a huge ransom, had to continue to work for landowners for many years and give them one third of the harvest from their vineyards and fields.
      This abolition of serfdom caused strong unrest among the peasant masses throughout the country. The peasants demanded complete freedom and the transfer of the necessary land to them free of charge. Troops were sent to pacify the peasants, with whom the peasants had bloody battles that ended in hundreds of killed and wounded.
      N. G. Chernyshevsky. The interests of the peasants were defended by the best, educated people of that time. One of them was the great Russian scientist and populist revolutionary **Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky**. Even as a child, he observed the difficult life of serfs and Volga barge haulers. During the preparation of the reform, Chernyshevsky wrote many articles in which he demanded that the peasants be given full freedom and all the land of the landowners for free.
     
      Nikolai Gavrilovich Chernyshevsky (1828–1889).
     
      After the February 19 manifesto, Chernyshevsky, together with other populist revolutionaries, called on the peasants to rebel against the tsar and landowners. For this purpose, Chernyshevsky wrote an appeal «To the lordly peasants», which was intercepted by the tsarist gendarmes.
      Alexander II put Chernyshevsky in the **Peter and Paul Fortress**, and then exiled him to hard labor. The staunch revolutionary did not renounce his beliefs, and the tsar kept him in a **Siberia**n prison and settlement for 19 years. Marx, Engels and **Lenin** highly valued Chernyshevsky as an outstanding scientist, a firm and courageous populist revolutionary.
     
      Nikolai Alekseevich Nekrasov (1821–1877).
     
      Poet N. A. Nekrasov. During these same years, the talented Russian poet **Nikolai Alekseevich Nekrasov** wrote his poems. His simple poems vividly show the bitter life of peasants in Tsarist Russia. He wrote about how people were cruelly abused under serfdom and how the peasants were mercilessly exploited after the reform by landowners and capitalists. «Instead of chains of serfs, people came up with many others», — wrote Nekrasov.
      Nekrasov's poems were the favorite songs of the revolutionaries of that time. The Russian people still sing them.
      Changes in management. Under serfdom, the landowner himself ruled his peasants and judged them.
      After the peasant reform, a village headman was appointed to govern in each village. Several villages and villages were united into a **volost**, which was managed by a volost foreman. The volost foreman and village elders were chosen from rich peasants. They were subordinate to the tsarist officials, extorted taxes from the peasants and helped the police pacify the peasants. In the volosts, volost judges were elected, who tried peasants in petty cases. Volost judges could sentence peasants to punishment with rods, fines and arrest. Corporal punishment was retained for peasants and criminal offenders.
      In provinces and districts, **zemstvo** governments were elected, which were in charge of schools, hospitals, and repairing bridges and roads. Money for all this was taken from the peasants. Few peasants were elected to zemstvo councils — one person each from 3,000 households. Peasant representatives in zemstvo administrations were mostly **kulaks**. All affairs in zemstvo administrations were managed by landowners. In cities, city councils were created to manage city affairs, and the right to elect to the **Duma** was granted only to manufacturers, merchants and wealthy homeowners.
      The order of military service was changed. Everyone over 21 years old began to be accepted into the army. The period of permanent military service was reduced to 6 years. But as before, peasants served in the army as simple soldiers, and nobles — as officers.
      Even after the reform, the Tsar and the landowners retained power in their hands, owned a huge amount of the best lands and kept the peasants under the strict supervision of the police and officials.
      But with the abolition of serfdom in Russia, there were more new factories and factories, railways began to be built faster, and trade began to develop more widely. Serf Russia was becoming a capitalist country.
     
41. The struggle of Poles for independence. Wars of Alexander II
     
      Polish uprising of 1863. For many years now, the Poles, led by the Polish nobility, have been preparing for the liberation of **Poland** from the power of the Russian Tsar. In **Warsaw**, the revolutionaries formed the «People's Committee», which prepared an uprising.
      Created by the Polish nobility «People's Committee» in 1863, it rebelled and declared itself the Polish government.
      The uprising engulfed Poland, part. **Lithuania**, part of **Belarus**. Rebel detachments gathered everywhere. The rebels were armed with **pistols**, **hunting rifles**, **pikes** and **sabers**. Avoiding decisive battles with large detachments of Russian troops, they began a **guerrilla war**. Detachments of the rebels hid in the forests and from there attacked the royal troops. Over a year and a half, over a thousand such small battles took place.
      There was a particularly strong uprising in Belarus. Here, under the leadership of **Kastus Kalinovsky**, peasants armed with **scythes** and **axes** burned landowners' estates, exterminated small detachments of Russian troops, killed landowners, tsarist officials and officers.
      Alexander II sent an entire army to suppress the uprising. Only after 18 months were the tsarist generals able to defeat the bravely fighting rebels. In Belarus and Lithuania, their suppression was led by the cruel **General Muravyov**. He mercilessly hanged the prisoners. The brave Kastus Kalinovsky was also captured and hanged.
      After the suppression of the uprising, the tsarist government exiled tens of thousands of Poles to Siberia.
      During the uprising, Tsar Alexander II hastened to issue a law abolishing serfdom in Poland and Lithuania on less difficult conditions for peasants than in other provinces of Russia: peasant duties were abolished, in Lithuania peasants received their previous land plots for a lower yen than in other provinces, and in Poland for free. The tsar needed this in order to win over the peasants against the Polish landowners.
      Conquest of Central Asia. At the same time, Tsar Alexander II began decisive conquests in Central Asia.
      Having gained a foothold in captured **Kazakhstan**, Tsarist Russia conquered **Kyrgyzstan** within 10 years. The Kyrgyz stubbornly resisted the Russian troops, but their resistance was broken.
      Moving along the course of the **Syr-Darya River**, Russian troops began to attack the city of **Uzbek**s — **Tashkent**. The Uzbeks fiercely defended their lands, and the Russians had to take the city of Tashkent twice. They became stronger in it only in 1865.
      Three years after the occupation of Tashkent, Russian troops captured the ancient city of **Bukhara — Samarkand** (once the capital of Tamerlane). The ruler of Bukhara — **emir** — recognized the power of the Russian Tsar over himself and had to give him the most fertile lands.
      Then the possessions of the **Khiva Khan** were subordinated. Khan also recognized himself as dependent on the Russian Tsar. Following this, the **Kokand Khanate** was conquered.
      The warlike tribes of **Turkmenistan** fought with the tsarist troops for their independence for 12 years. They repulsed strong detachments of Russian troops from their main fortress of **Geok Tepe** and lost it only after a crushing Russian offensive with strong artillery. Then **Ashgabat** was occupied by the royal troops.
      At the end of the 19th century, the mountainous **Pamirs** were conquered by Russia — «roof of the world».
      Thus, during 30 years of stubborn wars, the lands of the peoples of Central Asia were conquered by Tsarist Russia.
      Following the Russian troops, tsarist officials and traders moved to Central Asia. They took heavy taxes from the population, took away their lands and property, cheated and deceived them in trade. The khans, elders and **mullahs** bribed by the king helped them plunder the conquered peoples.
      Cotton from **America**n seeds began to be sown on convenient lands. Cotton was needed by Russia's growing textile factories. All the benefits from sowing cotton fell into the hands of the local rich and Russian manufacturers, who profited from the labor of the enslaved poor — Uzbeks, Turkmens and **Tajik**s.
      The peoples of Central Asia were given over to the full power of tsarist generals, nobles and capitalists. More than once the oppressed masses rebelled, but the force was on the side of the Russian nobles, who were helped by the wealthy part of the indigenous population.
      Central Asia became a colony of Tsarist Russia.
      War with Turkey. At the end of the reign of Alexander II (in 1877) Russia fought with Turkey. The Russian Tsar failed to capture the straits from the Black Sea to the **Mediterranean** this time too. Under a peace treaty with Turkey, Russia received a large commercial port on the Black Sea of **Batumi**. As a result of this war, the Slavic peoples in the **Balkans** (Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.), as well as **Romania**, were liberated from Turkish rule. Despite the huge superiority of Russian forces over Turkey, due to Russia's backwardness, the war cost it enormous sacrifices: hundreds of thousands of poorly armed soldiers died in vain.
     
42. I International and the Paris Commune
     
      I International. Marx and Engels considered the revolutionary movement of European workers in 1848 only the beginning of the proletariat's struggle for its liberation. They knew that this struggle would be difficult and that the bourgeoisie would defend its dominance. The great leaders of the proletariat believed that in order to successfully fight the bourgeoisie, the proletariat needed to organize its own international party. Therefore, they created the first international association of the proletariat.
      In 1864, at a congress of workers' representatives in London, at the suggestion of Marx and Engels, the «International Workers' Association» — First International was founded. The leader of the First International was Karl Marx. I International united the labor movement of different countries. Marx developed a unified program for this movement. For about ten years, Marx led the First International and organized the working masses. Engels was his faithful assistant.
      Marx and Engels stubbornly and persistently defended the interests of the working class and waged a constant struggle against everyone who showed the wrong and harmful paths to the proletariat. Marx and Engels tirelessly exposed those who, calling themselves socialists, but in fact being supporters of capitalists and traitors to the workers, convinced the workers that socialism could be built peacefully, without overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie. Marx and Engels also tirelessly explained the enormous harm caused by those people who considered themselves revolutionaries, but went against the establishment of the power of the workers, against the dictatorship of the proletariat. They said that such views were beneficial only to the enemies of the working class, the capitalists. These views were harmful because they reconciled workers with capitalist exploitation, weakened the power of the proletariat, and made it easier for capitalists to deal with workers.
      Paris Commune. In 1870, war began between Prussia and France. Prussia won this war. The French troops were defeated. The French **Emperor Napoleon III** and his army were captured. A revolution of the working and petty-bourgeois urban masses began in Paris. But the bourgeoisie came to power. Prussian troops were moving to Paris. Then an armed army of citizens — «national guard» was created in Paris, in which there were many workers.
      The Germans approached Paris and besieged it. The workers' battalions rose to defend their city and vowed to die, but not to give the city to the enemy. In the ring of enemy troops, the population of Paris held firm for four and a half months. The workers and their families were starving. The bourgeois government, fearing the workers' uprising against the bourgeoisie, committed direct treason — secretly from the people, it agreed with the Germans to surrender Paris to them. But the workers remained armed. The German troops, seeing the formidable strength of the Parisian workers, did not dare to enter the city.
      Then the **minister** of the bourgeois government, a despicable traitor, an enemy of the people — Thiers sent a detachment of soldiers to suddenly take away the cannons from the workers. But female workers noticed the approach of this detachment and raised the alarm. The National Guard recaptured the cannons. Many soldiers went over to the side of the people and immediately shot two of their generals. Then Thiers, ministers, generals, bourgeoisie, speculators, officials and priests fled from Paris to Versailles.
      On March 18, 1871, power in Paris passed into the hands of the working class. The working class formed its own government — **Paris Commune**. Some of the members of the Paris Commune were **socialists**, members of the First International.
      Marx and Engels called on the Commune to attack **Versailles**, where the bourgeois government of Thiers had taken refuge. But the Commune hesitated to take such a step. The indecisiveness of the Paris Commune is explained by the fact that it included many petty-bourgeois, wavering revolutionaries who believed in the «good intentions of» the bourgeoisie. Marx harshly criticized this indecision of theirs. Meanwhile, Thiers' troops surrounded Paris in a close ring.
      The commune handed over the factories to the fleeing bourgeoisie into the hands of workers. Churches and monasteries were turned into folk clubs. Everything was done to improve the situation of workers. An order was issued for workers to move from dark and damp basements to the homes of the rich.
      The whole world followed with tension the great struggle of the Parisian proletarians. But the **Communards** were under siege, they were cut off from the rest of France. They failed to establish an alliance of workers and peasants against the bourgeoisie, and failed to win over the peasantry.
      The Communards fought heroically against the numerous and well-armed troops of the Versailles bourgeois government. Women and children fought alongside men On 21 May, Thiers' troops stormed into Paris. German troops helped Thiers. The bourgeoisie brutally dealt with the Communards. Within a week, tens of thousands of men, women and children were shot. More workers were thrown into prison and exiled to distant islands, to hard labor.
     
      The battle of the Communards with **Thiers' troops** in one of the squares of Paris.
     
      The Paris Commune was defeated. It existed for 71 days and remained in the memory of the proletariat forever. Every year, workers bring wreaths to the grave of the Communards in one of the cemeteries in Paris, where the heroes of the Commune were shot against the wall.
      The Paris Commune perished because the workers did not yet have their own workers', Marxist, revolutionary party, capable of leading the workers against the bourgeoisie without hesitation. And also because the workers did not have the support of the peasants, they did not understand the importance of the union of workers and peasants. Five years after the fall of the Paris Commune, in 1876, the First International ceased to exist.
      The significance of the First International was enormous. It was the first international association of workers and served as a model for the Communist International founded by Lenin.
      Karl Marx died in 1883 and Engels in 1895. Their teachings directed the workers’ struggle for communism to the right path and formed the basis of V.’s activities. AND. Lenin and our Communist Party.
     
43. Capitalism in Russia
     
      Life of workers and peasants under capitalism. After the reform of 1861, tens of millions of peasants continued to live in terrible writing and lack of rights. They had little land. To feed themselves and pay taxes, peasants had to lease land from landowners or borrow money from them. Landowners forced peasants to cultivate the lord's land with peasant horses and tools on enslaving terms.
      Landowners, like spiders, sucked everything they could out of the peasants. By the end of the 19th century, half of all peasants became poor, either having no horses at all, or having one emaciated horse. The middle peasants were still somehow running their farm. If there was a shortage or crop failure, the middle peasants became poor, became even more dependent on the landowners and peasant kulaks, and had to work for them like farm laborers.
     
      Barge haulers on the Volga. From the painting by I. E. Repin.
     
      Peasants, except landowners, were robbed and oppressed by their fists. Ruined peasants went to the cities. Cities grew quickly, and industries developed in them. At the end of the 19th century, there were already more than 2 million workers in Russia. Large industrial centers were formed: in **St. Petersburg** and **Nizhny Novgorod** (now the city of Gorky) — machine-building plants; in **Tula**, the **Urals** and the **Donetsk basin** — metallurgical plants; in the **Moscow**, **Vladimir**, **Kostroma** and **Yaroslavl** provinces — textile factories.
      The ruined peasants headed to these places. Many workers were also needed to build railways. By the end of the 19th century, there were already more than 30 thousand kilometers of railways in Russia, and construction of a road through Siberia began.
      Hundreds of thousands of peasant families moved here to the vast Siberian lands. In the harsh natural conditions of Siberia, they worked hard to develop the richest region. Peasants penetrated into the remote **taiga**. The ancient possessions of Russia were populated by bankrupt peasants.
      The lives of the workers were no better. Breeders and manufacturers forced workers, not only men, but also women and children, to work 13–14 hours a day. Often the working day lasted 17–18 hours. They were forced to work on holidays. There were no vacations.
      They paid pennies for such hard labor, because a mass of hungry people stood at the gates of factories and factories and asked to be given work.
     
      The workers demand that the owner increase their wages.
     
      For any reason, the workers were fined — and part of their earnings was withheld. The factories were dirty, damp, dark, there weren’t even windows in the windows.
      The workers lived in cramped and dirty **barracks houses**, where workers of different shifts slept on the same beds: only some got up when others fell into their places.
      Both the worker and the peasant had equal powerlessness in Tsarist Russia. The workers in factories and factories rather began to unite and oppose their oppressors. And then the peasants followed them.
      Populists. The leading role of the working class was not understood by many Russian revolutionaries of that time. They incorrectly believed that all power was in the peasantry and that one could free oneself from the power of the tsar and landowners through a peasant uprising alone. They did not understand that peasants alone, without an alliance with the working class, could not defeat tsarism and landowners.
      These revolutionaries, soon after the peasant reform of 1861, in many cities of Russia began to organize revolutionary circles of youth secretly from the authorities, most of them students. The question of how to help the peasantry was hotly discussed in the circles. It was decided to go through the villages («to the people», as they said then) and call on the peasants to rebel against the tsar and the landowners. That is why these revolutionaries were called **populists**. But the peasants did not follow the populists.
      Then the populists decided to continue the fight without the people, on their own. They decided to start with the murder of the king and organized a secret society, which they called «People's Will». They spent a lot of effort and time preparing the murder of the king. Only on March 1, 1881, the populists managed to kill Alexander II with a thrown bomb.
      But nothing came of it. Instead of one murdered king or minister, another, even more fierce one appeared. The son of Alexander II — **Alexander III** became king, under whom life became even worse for workers and peasants. Almost all the revolutionaries «of the People's Will» were tracked down by the tsarist gendarmes and arrested. By order of Alexander III, five of them were hanged, while others were put in a fortress for life or exiled to hard labor.
      The failure of the populists was not accidental. The path they chose to fight tsarism, the path of terror, was erroneous and very harmful for the revolution.
      The activities of the Populists were harmful because they prevented the working class from understanding its leading role in the revolution and slowed down the creation of the Marxist Workers' Party, diverted the attention of the working people from fighting the entire class of oppressors with the useless murders of individual representatives of this class, and slowed down the creation of an alliance of workers and peasants.
      In 1887, a small group of revolutionaries again tried to kill the Tsar (Alexander III), but failed. The organizers of the assassination attempt — Lenin's older brother **Alexander Ulyanov** and his comrades — were captured by gendarmes and hanged. Repeated error brought the same harm.
      **Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin)** was already 17 years old at that time. Having learned about his brother’s execution, he said: «No, we will not go this way. This is not the path we should take». Lenin was right. Only the organized working class, in alliance with the peasantry, leading the peasantry, could achieve complete victory over the power of the tsar and landowners.
      Russian scientists, writers and artists. In the second half of the 19th century there were many talented scientists, writers, artists and composers.
      Great Russian scientists lived at this time. **Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev** made outstanding discoveries in chemistry. He worked hard to study the natural resources of our country. **Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov** was the first to scientifically explain the functioning of the human brain. **Nikolai Egorovich Zhukovsky** discovered the laws that need to be known when building airplanes. He is called «the father of Russian aviation». **Alexander Stepanovich Popov** invented radio.

      Ilya Efimovich Repin (1844–1930).
     
      Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (1828–1910).
     
      The greatest Russian writer **Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy** began writing his works while still young, when he participated in the wars with the mountaineers of the Caucasus and in the defense of **Sevastopol** during the Crimean War. Tolstoy wrote his largest works after he left military service and settled on his estate «**Yasnaya Polyana**» (not far from the city of **Tula**). His main work «**War and Peace**» tells in a vivid artistic form about the war between Russia and **Napoleon I** in 1812. In his works, Tolstoy described the life of landowners under serfdom and under the capitalist system. At the end of his life, he began to write about the hopeless situation of the peasants after the reform of 1861. Tolstoy was not a supporter of the revolution. But he saw the hard life of peasants and castigated the arbitrariness of tsarist officials, landowners and capitalists.
      The great Russian artists **Ilya Efimovich Repin** and **Vasily Ivanovich Surikov** also lived in the same years. Repin was born in Ukraine into the family of a soldier and loved to draw since childhood. Surikov was born in Siberia into a **Cossack** family. Repin and Surikov knew the life of the peasant well, since they themselves came from the people. Their paintings are known throughout the world.
      In the second half of the 19th century, great Russian composers lived and created major musical works — **Mussorgsky**, **Rimsky-Korsakov**, **Borodin**, **Tchaikovsky**.
      Mussorgsky wrote the opera «**Boris Godunov**», and Rimsky-Korsakov — operas «**The Snow Maiden**» and «**Sadko**». In their operas they widely used songs of peoples living in Russia. We often listen to all these wonderful works in our time.
     
44. Labor movement of the 70s–90s. IN. AND. Lenin
     
      The first workers' unions. Even under Tsar Alexander II, workers began to fight the capitalists.
      The workers jointly presented demands to the owner of the factory or plant to improve their situation and refused to start work until the owner satisfied these demands. This is called a **strike**.
      In order to more successfully fight the capitalists, workers began to unite in alliances.
      The first — «South Russian Union» arose in **Odessa** in 1875. The Union prepared to fight the autocracy and called on workers to unite to fight for the revolution. But soon its participants were arrested. His leader **Zaslavsky** was exiled to hard labor, where he died.
      In St. Petersburg, three years later, the «Northern Union of Russian Workers» was organized, headed by the carpenter **Khalturin** and the mechanic **Obnorsky**. This union has already begun to take part in workers' strikes and led them. The tsarist government also defeated this workers' union.
      But the labor movement covered more and more new areas. Life was getting harder and harder for the worker, and the capitalists were robbing him more and more.
      Manufacturer **Morozov** mercilessly fined his workers. Under the guise of fines, he took 1/3 of their earnings. In 1885, eight thousand workers of Morozov's textile factory in **Orekhovo-Zuevo** could not withstand this robbery and went on strike. The factory stopped.
      This strike was organized in advance. It was led by the advanced worker **Moiseenko**, who was previously a member of the «Northern Union of Russian Workers». Together with a group of his fellow weavers, he wrote demands on the manufacturer, and the workers approved these demands in a secret meeting.
     
      Meeting of workers before the Morozov strike.
     
      Morozov refused to comply with the workers' demands and achieved the arrest of one of their leaders. A crowd of weavers forcibly freed the arrested comrade. Morozov called troops to the factory, who defeated the workers. 600 strikers were arrested, several dozen of them were put on trial.
      Such strikes took place in Russia in many factories. The following year, the tsarist government, frightened by the growth of the labor movement and strikes, was forced to issue a law according to which factory owners could no longer so brazenly cheat workers.
      The workers realized that they could achieve a lot through organized struggle.
      The advanced workers of Russia first began to become acquainted with the teachings of Marx and Engels in workers' circles and unions.
      Group «Liberation of Labor». At the same time, proletarian revolutionaries appeared in Russia — supporters of the teachings of Marx, who believed that the leading role in the revolutionary movement should belong to the proletariat.
      One such revolutionary was **Georgy Valentinovich Plekhanov**, the first propagandist of Marxism in Russia.
     
      Georgy Valentinovich Plekhanov (1856–1918).
     
      After going abroad, Plekhanov formed the revolutionary Marxist group «Liberation of Labor» in 1883. The group translated the works of Marx and Engels into Russian and distributed them in Russia. She also pointed out the enormous harm to the labor movement of the teachings of the Populists and their methods of struggle.
      In Russia, circles began to develop rapidly in which the works of Marx were studied. But both the group «Liberation of Labor» and these circles were not yet associated with the labor movement.
      This was done by Lenin, who organized the **Bolshevik Party** and led the working class and peasantry to fight the tsarist government, landowners and the bourgeoisie.

      IN. AND. Lenin — leader of the working class and founder of **Bolshevism**. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (Ulyanov) was born in 1870 in the city of **Simbirsk** (now Ulyanovsk). He did great at school. At the age of 17, Lenin became a student at **Kazan University**, but was soon expelled for participating in the revolutionary student movement. Then he began to prepare to take exams for the entire university program. He passed these exams.
      In Kazan, Lenin joined the Marxist circle, studied the works of Marx and Engels and amazed everyone with his knowledge.
      In 1893, Lenin moved to St. Petersburg and here began to work with workers in circles.
      Lenin united all the workers' circles in St. Petersburg into the «Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class» and thereby prepared the creation of a truly revolutionary workers' party. At his suggestion, the same unions were organized in other cities.

      Lenin mercilessly fought with the populists and with all those who incorrectly explained the teachings of Marx.
      Lenin delved into every little detail of the lives of workers, wrote leaflets and books for workers, calling for a stubborn struggle against the capitalists.
      The royal detectives managed to arrest Lenin. He was kept in prison for a long time, and then exiled to Siberia for three years.
      The «Struggle Unions» organized by Lenin made the first attempt to unite into a party. For this purpose, the 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) was convened in 1898 in the city of **Minsk**. But it was not possible to create a party at this congress.
      Returning from exile, Lenin went abroad and there began to publish the first Marxist newspaper. It was called «**Spark**».
      The newspaper «**Iskra**» was printed on thin tissue paper to make it easier to bring it from abroad to Russia in various secret ways.
      Lenin wrote an article in «Iskra» calling on workers to unite into a revolutionary political party to fight autocracy and capitalists.
      Leninskaya «Iskra» prepared the creation of the Bolshevik Party.
      The workers' struggle flared up and soon engulfed the outskirts of Russia, including Transcaucasia, where Lenin's student **Comrade Stalin** had been working since the late nineties of the last century.
     
X. First bourgeois revolution in Russia
     
45. On the eve of the revolution
     
      Obukhov defense and Rostov strike. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the revolutionary struggle of workers has intensified. Workers staged strikes, demonstrated and rose up to fight against the capitalists and the tsarist government.
      **Nicholas II** was king at that time. (He began reigning in 1894.)
      In 1901, in St. Petersburg, on the day of May 1 (a holiday of workers around the world), workers of the **Obukhov military plant** went on strike. They presented their demands to their superiors. The confused administration did not know what to do and asked the workers: «So, why are you not only demanding that we, but soon the ministers be fired?» — «Not only the ministers, but also the tsar himself», — the strikers answered them.
      The plant authorities called the police and troops to pacify the workers. But strikers in and around the plant built barricades and greeted the arriving pacifiers with a hail of stones and fragments of iron. Police and soldiers opened fire. For several hours, workers fought with the troops.
     
      Dispersal of strikers.
     
      Several workers were killed and seriously wounded. This struggle of workers was called the **Obukhov defense**. About 800 defense participants were arrested, many of them were hidden in prison for a long time and exiled to hard labor.
      The news about the Obukhov heroes spread throughout the country. Workers rose to fight in all corners of vast Russia.
      In 1902, a large strike of railway workers took place in the city of **Rostov-on-Don**. They were joined by workers from other factories. The strike and workers' meetings were led by the **RSDLP** committee. Members of the committee openly spoke at meetings, calling on the workers to fight decisively and steadfastly until complete victory over the tsarist government. Workers' rallies took place outside the city for several days. Up to 30 thousand workers of Rostov-on-Don gathered at these meetings. The police and local Rostov troops could not do anything about the strikers.
      The Rostov authorities called Cossacks from neighboring cities to suppress the strike. Only then was the strike stopped.
      The Rostov strike showed that the working class of Russia had already risen to an open political struggle with the tsarist government.
      Peasant movement. The peasants also rose up for the workers. In the spring and summer of 1902 in Ukraine and the Volga region, the struggle of peasants engulfed more than 300 villages and hamlets. Peasants destroyed landowners' estates, divided landowners' bread among the hungry, and seized landowners' lands.
      Troops were sent against the peasants. The peasants were shot at and beaten to death with rods. Thousands of peasants were arrested and imprisoned. The peasant movement was suppressed. The peasants did not yet understand that in order to defeat the landowners, it was necessary, first of all, to destroy the tsarist power.
      Lenin in the newspaper «Iskra» called on the peasants to fight against tsarist power together with the workers. But the work of **Social Democrats** and supporters «Iskra» in the village was hampered by the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SR) that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century. This party, under the guise of protecting the peasants, defended the interests of the kulaks and tried to carry out the wrong program of the populists.
      Lenin waged a persistent struggle against the Socialist Revolutionaries.
      Creation of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. Leninskaya «Iskra» rallied around herself disparate social democratic organizations in Russia. What could not be done before — to create a revolutionary proletarian party has now been achieved.
      In 1903, the Second Congress of the RSDLP secretly met abroad. 43 delegates came to the congress from different cities of Russia. At the congress, the party program developed by V. AND. Lenin. It spoke about the main task of the working class party — organizing a socialist revolution, establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the victory of socialism. But in order to achieve the main task, the program stated that the party must achieve, first of all, its immediate task — to overthrow the tsarist autocracy in Russia, create a democratic republic, establish an 8-hour working day for workers, destroy all remnants of serfdom in the village, cut land to peasants.
      To carry out these great tasks, Lenin demanded that only persistent fighters for the work cause, proven friends of the working class, be accepted into the party. The party, Lenin said, should be the vanguard of the working class, and its members should be selflessly devoted to the revolution. Lenin demanded that only a person who accepts his program and participates in personal work in one of its organizations could be a member of the party. This demand of Lenin was opposed by **Martov**,**Trotsky** and some other delegates. They offered to accept everyone into the party and all those who promised to provide at least some assistance to the party, and did not require mandatory work in its organizations and subordination to party discipline. Such a proposal weakened the party as a leader of the working class, since unstable people could penetrate the partypeople from the bourgeoisie hostile to the party.
      Following this, Lenin’s opponents, led by Martov and Trotsky, proposed that the workers, in order to fight tsarism, enter into an alliance not with the working peasantry, but with the bourgeoisie. Lenin exposed the harm of the proposals of Martov and Trotsky and argued that the working class could not enter into an agreement with the bourgeoisie, that it would betray the workers. The workers need to unite not with the bourgeoisie, but with the revolutionary peasantry and go together to fight against the tsar and the landowners. Lenin and his supporters stood for the fact that after the overthrow of tsarism and landowners, they would immediately begin the fight against capitalists, the fight for socialism.
      The congress elected the Central Committee of the party and the editorial office of the newspaper «Iskra», which it instructed to manage the work of the party. Lenin's supporters were elected to the Central Committee and the editorial office «Iskra», they received a majority of votes at the congress, for which they began to be called **Bolsheviks**, and his opponents, who received a minority at the congress, — **Mensheviks**. The majority of social democratic organizations in Russia supported the Bolsheviks after the congress.
      Comrade Stalin was not present at the Second Congress; he was in prison. In 1904, he fled Siberian exile and led the workers of Transcaucasia after the Bolsheviks.
      The advanced workers firmly believed in Lenin and Stalin. There were thousands of such workers then.
      Under the leadership of the RSDLP, in the summer of 1903, the first general strikes of workers took place in large cities of Ukraine and the Caucasus. All factories and factories stopped. Workers gathered in thousands in the streets and squares. The speakers spoke about the revolution. Workers organized processions — demonstrations with red flags — banners of the proletarian struggle for socialism. Having gathered troops into the cities, the tsarist government suppressed these strikes.
      But the strikes had their effect — they accelerated and brought the revolution closer.
     
46. The revolution has begun
     
      War with **Japan**. Tsar Nicholas II tried by all means to strangle the revolution. The king's associates advised him to quickly start a long-prepared war with Japan. They believed that war would delay the revolution. «War is better than revolution», — Nicholas II was advised by his courtiers.
      But the Japanese were the first to start the war. In January 1904, without any declaration of war, they treacherously attacked the Russian-built fortress on the **Yellow Sea** — **Port Arthur**, where Russian warships were stationed, and blew up the best of them with mines.
      Japan transported troops from its islands by sea to **Manchuria**. The well-armed and trained Japanese army began to beat the backward tsarist army, poorly armed and led by incompetent generals — bribe-takers and thieves.
      The Japanese took the fortress of Port Arthur and defeated the tsarist army at **Mukden**. In the narrow **Tsushima Strait**, the Japanese destroyed the last warships of Tsarist Russia sent from the **Baltic Sea**.
      The tsarist autocracy, defeated in the war, concluded a shameful peace with Japan. Japan took half of **Sakhalin Island**, Port Arthur, from Russia and strengthened itself in **Korea**.
      Bloody Sunday and the first Council of Workers' Deputies. The unsuccessful Russo-Japanese War further increased the people's hatred of the tsarist government. The war did not delay the revolution, but accelerated it.
      At the beginning of January 1905, the large **Putilov plant** (now Kirovsky) went on strike in St. Petersburg.
      Soon a general strike began in St. Petersburg. There were stormy gatherings and meetings at the factories. The workers were looking for a way out of their disastrous and powerless situation. They put forward demands for an eight-hour working day, freedom of association, freedom of the press and speech. The workers also demanded the transfer of landowners' land to the peasants and the convening of a Constituent Assembly to change the political system in Russia.
      To combat the labor movement, a few months before the strike, the tsarist government created the «Workers' Society», headed by the provocateur **Pop Gapon**. When the strike began, Gapon, at meetings of his society, persuaded the workers to organize a procession to the king and write him a petition. In this petition, the workers included all their demands. The Bolsheviks persuaded the workers not to listen to Gapon. «Freedom and land are not obtained by requests to the king, — they said, — they must be conquered with arms in hand». But Gapon convinced the workers to go with this petition to the king. Gapon had a hidden intention: to cause bloodshed among the workers and thereby weaken the labor movement.
      On January 9, 1905, in the early frosty morning, crowds of workers with their wives and children moved towards the **Winter Palace**. In total, over 140 thousand people gathered.
      The tsarist troops greeted the unarmed people with **volleys**. More than a thousand people were killed, hacked to death with sabers, and crushed by Cossack horses. The streets of St. Petersburg were flooded with the blood of workers.
     
      On January 9, 1905, hundreds of workers were shot in the square near the Winter Palace.
     
      The workers learned a bloody lesson that day. It became clear to everyone that the king and his servants could not be trusted. In the evening of the same day, workers began building barricades on the outskirts. Red flags fluttered on the barricades. Workers attacked officers and police officers and disarmed them. The Bolsheviks led the workers' struggle.
      An explosion of indignation at the bloody atrocity of the tsar swept across the country. Workers quit their jobs, went out into the streets with revolutionary songs, with the slogan «Down with the tsarist autocracy». The revolution soon spread throughout the country.
      Mass strikes and workers' protests continued throughout the spring.
      In May 1905, a particularly stubborn strike began in the city of textile factories — **Ivanovo-Voznesensk** —. The leaders of the workers were the Bolsheviks.
      Thousands of workers gathered outside the city on the **Talka River**. They elected deputies who formed the Council to lead their fight against tsarist power and manufacturers.
      It was one of the first Councils of Workers' Deputies in Russia. This Council, surrounded by thousands of workers, met daily. The Bolsheviks who headed the Council spoke at the working meetings. The crowd eagerly listened to the revolutionary speeches of the speakers. The heroic struggle of the workers lasted more than two months. The workers and their families starved, but did not give up. But by order of the tsarist governor, the troops began to shoot at the workers. Finally, the workers' strength ran out. At the proposal of the Council, at a meeting of 40,000 workers, it was decided to stop the strike. The strike hardened the workers and prepared them for further, even more stubborn struggle.
      Peasant movement. In the spring of 1905, unrest among peasants began. In the center of Russia and the **Volga region**, peasants seized land and timber, took bread from landowners' barns and divided it among the hungry. They burned the estates of landowners, demanded division, and in a number of places seized landowners' lands. Frightened landowners fled their estates under the protection of troops and police. The tsarist government sent soldiers and Cossacks against the peasants. The troops shot, imprisoned and flogged the peasants. But the peasants, supported by workers in the cities, did not stop fighting. The peasant movement expanded every day.
     
      Peasants seize a landowner's estate.
     
      In Georgia, peasants stopped paying duties to landowners. In a number of places they seized land, pastures, forests, and did not recognize any tsarist authorities. The peasants themselves managed the affairs.
      In Latvia and Estonia, farm laborers rebelled in the spring and summer of 1905. They armed themselves and formed revolutionary peasant committees. Relying on these organizations, they expelled landowners — German barons from the villages of Latvia and Estonia.
      Peasants of Ukraine and Belarus also rose up to fight the tsarist government and landowners.
      III Congress of the RSDLP. In London in April 1905 at the insistence of. Lenin's 3rd Congress of the RSDLP was convened. In total, the party then had up to 8 1/2 thousand members. Delegates from 20 Bolshevik party committees gathered at the congress. The Mensheviks refused to take part in the work of the congress and did not appear at the congress.
      Lenin said at the congress that for the victory of the revolution it was necessary to: create and strengthen an alliance of workers and peasants, start an armed uprising with united forces, overthrow the tsar and create a revolutionary government of workers and peasants. The peasants must create their own revolutionary committees and take all the land from the landowners without any ransom. The workers must lead and support this struggle of the peasants.
      Lenin further said that after the overthrow of the power of the tsar and the landowners, the Bolsheviks should lead the workers and the poorest peasants to fight the capitalists and kulaks, to fight for the socialist revolution.
      The 3rd Congress accepted all these Leninist proposals.
      The delegates returned to Russia and began to implement the decisions of the congress with great energy.
      At the same time, together with Lenin, Stalin, who worked in Transcaucasia, led the struggle for the victory of the revolution. Stalin strengthened Bolshevik committees here, prepared the Bolshevik Congress, created an underground printing house, wrote leaflets for workers, taught and united revolutionary workers and peasants, and supervised the preparation of an armed uprising. Comrade Stalin put a lot of work into uniting the workers and working peoples of Transcaucasia and all of Russia into a single family.
     
47. Preparation of an armed uprising
     
      Insurrection on the battleship «Potemkin». The revolution spread to the army. In June 1905, a sailors' uprising broke out on the Black Sea on the battleship «**Potemkin**».
     
      Insurrection on the battleship «Potemkin» in June 1905.
     
      The battleship was anchored near Odessa, where workers were on strike. The sailors knew about the events in Odessa, were very excited and were eager to fight to the aid of the workers, who called on them to fight.
      One day during lunch, one of the sailors shouted:
      — Guys, there are worms in the **borscht**!
      The ship's officers fed the sailors rotten meat and appropriated the money for themselves.
      This case of worms in borscht hastened the outbreak. A murmur arose among the sailors. The ship's commander appeared and ordered the sailors to disperse. The sailors did not listen. The commander ordered the arrest of 30 sailors and their shooting. The sailors' hearts began to boil with anger and resentment. At the call of sailor **Matyushenko**, they armed themselves and shouted «Beat the monsters!» they rushed at the hated officers, killed them and threw them overboard.
      A red flag flew over «Potemkin».
      The Tsar sent military vessels to pacify «Potemkin». But the sailors of these ships refused to shoot at the rebel battleship. «Potemkin», however, could not survive for long without coal and food. There were not enough experienced Bolshevik leaders there.
      The Potemkinites were forced to leave for Romania and surrendered to the local authorities.
      Despite the failure of the uprising on «Potemkin», it inspired the workers. They saw that the navy and army were beginning to go over to the side of the revolution.
      October general strike. By the fall of 1905, the revolutionary movement had spread throughout the country. Every day the ranks of the strikers were replenished with workers from new factories and factories. On the streets, workers held meetings and often entered into battles with the police and troops who dispersed them.
      At the beginning of October, a strike began on the Moscow railways, which soon engulfed the railways throughout the country. The post office and telegraph office stopped working.
      Teachers, doctors, professors, and students began to be drawn into the struggle for the workers. In **Kharkov** and **Yekaterinoslav** (now Dnepropetrovsk), workers began to build barricades and, having destroyed weapons stores, entered into a shootout with troops and police.
      Under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, trade unions (trade unions) of workers were organized in many cities. Councils of workers' deputies were created in large industrial centers. These were the embryos of a new, revolutionary power of workers and peasants. Many Councils of Workers' Deputies prepared for the uprising, obtaining weapons in different ways and training workers in military affairs. In almost all large plants and factories where Bolshevik party organizations were located, combat squads were created. The tsarist government gave the order to the troops: «do not spare cartridges» and mercilessly shoot the strikers.
      In a number of cities, troops shot at workers, we will disperse the meetings. The workers could not yet begin an armed uprising. There were very few combat squads, there were not enough weapons. But the tsar also did not have the strength to suppress the revolutionary movement. There was a great ferment in his troops: the soldiers began to clearly sympathize with the revolution. This was helped by the work of the Bolsheviks in the army, where they secretly distributed their leaflets, calling on soldiers to join the revolution. This was also helped by the defeat of the tsar in the war with Japan.
      Frightened by the growth of the revolution, Tsar Nicholas II issued a manifesto on October 17. In the manifesto, he promised to give the people freedom and convene the State Duma from representatives of the population to decide, together with the Tsar, all state affairs of Russia. The manifesto of October 17 was a clear deception. The tsarist government needed to buy time to gather strength and drown the revolution in blood. Despite the manifesto on freedoms, the police continued to disperse meetings, arrest and kill workers and their Bolshevik leaders. In Moscow, the tsarist pogromists killed a wonderful Bolshevik — the leader of the Moscow workers — **Nikolai Ernestovich Bauman**. At Bauman's funeral, a hundred thousand Moscow workers walked behind his coffin, led by the Moscow Committee of the Bolshevik Party.
      In November 1905, Lenin came from abroad. He led the work of the party and the struggle of the working people.
      Meanwhile, in Transcaucasia, Stalin also firmly, in **Leninist style**, prepared the working people for battles with the Tsar and his servants. He exposed the Mensheviks who were against the preparation of an armed uprising. Comrade Stalin told the workers of the city of **Tbilisi**: «What does it take to really win? This requires three things, understand and remember well: the first thing we need — weapons, the second — weapons, the third — weapons again and again».
      In December 1905, the issue of an armed uprising was discussed at a Bolshevik conference.
      Here Lenin and Stalin met in person for the first time. And before that, they kept in touch with each other through letters and through comrades.
     
48. December armed uprising
     
      Armed uprising of Moscow workers On December 7, 1905, a general strike began in Moscow, which quickly turned into an armed uprising. At an hour pre-arranged by the Bolsheviks, factories, factories and railways stopped, and the electricity went out. Newspapers stopped publishing. The workers began to arm themselves, and combat squads grew. Police and troops dispersed workers' meetings and shot at houses where vigilantes were gathering. Workers on **Bronnaya**, **Tverskaya** (now Gorky Street), near the train stations, near the **Guzhon plant** (now «Hammer and Sickle») began to build barricades. Soon, many streets of Moscow were covered with barricades of carts, tram cars, barrels, boxes, and street lamps. All this fell down in the middle of the street, wrapped in telegraph and tram wires. The royal cavalry and mounted police could not move through these barriers. At many barricades, militant squads of workers armed with revolvers fired at the troops. There was a continuous firefight on the streets of Moscow for several dienas. **Soy squads** from other places rushed to help Moscow. The brave Bolshevik M. came from **Ivanovo-Voznesensk** with his fighting workers' squad. IN. Frunze.
      Peasants brought bread and potatoes to Moscow for workers, and sometimes joined the ranks of fighters on the barricades. **Presnya** (a working-class district of Moscow) became the center of the struggle. The vigilantes were led by the Bolsheviks. Under their leadership, Presnya held out against the tsarist troops for 10 days. It was a proletarian fortress, where power belonged to the rebel workers. Presnensky workers heroically defended their area. The workers were helped by their wives. They bandaged the wounded and fed them. The youth were distinguished by their enormous courage. She went on reconnaissance missions, helped build barricades and ambushes, and fight troops.
     
      Workers fight on the barricades and Moscow in December 1905.
     
      Workers on the Kazan railway also fought stubbornly with the tsarist troops.
      There were not enough troops in Moscow against the rebel people. The Tsar sent two regiments of soldiers to Moscow. Only with the help of cannons and machine guns was it possible to defeat the rebels. General **Dubasov** smashed Moscow. On December 18, the combat squads had to leave the barricades and hide their weapons in secret warehouses. More than a thousand people were killed in Moscow. Fires caused by artillery shells burned in the city for several days. The corpses of murdered workers, women and children lay on the streets. Many fighters of the revolution were shot and hanged by the tsarist troops.
      This is how the royal executioners dealt with the rebel Moscow.
      During the armed uprising, Lenin was in St. Petersburg. The Central Committee of Bolsheviks took all measures to rouse the workers to revolt in St. Petersburg. According to the Mensheviks, led by Trotsky, who settled in the St. Petersburg Council, opposed support for an armed uprising in Moscow. The Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries disrupted the workers' revolution. They supported the bourgeoisie, which conspired with the tsarist government to suppress the revolution. The strike that began in St. Petersburg in December ended without causing an armed uprising.
      The struggle of peasants with landowners. During the revolution of almost all of Russia, under the influence of the labor movement and calls of the Bolshevik Party, peasants rose up against their oppressors and landowners. Almost all the provinces of Russia were covered by the peasant movement. More than 7 thousand peasant revolutionary uprisings took place during the three years of revolutionary struggle. Peasants seized lands from landowners and monasteries, cut down landowners' and monastery forests, attacked landowners' estates everywhere and burned them. In the **Saratov** province alone, in the fall and winter of 1905, peasants destroyed up to 300 landowner estates. Peasants expelled the police, **volost** elders and village elders and established their own elected power. The most advanced peasants united into peasant unions. The Bolsheviks helped them with this.The Tsar and landowners sent punitive detachments and suppressed peasant uprisings.
      Armed uprisings of the oppressed peoples of Russia. In Transcaucasia, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, workers and peasants fought bravely with the tsarist troops. All of Georgia was engulfed in rebellion. A mass of tsarist troops was sent to Georgia. Georgian workers and peasants entered into battles with them more than once.
      In December 1905, many cities and villages of Georgia were burning like fires lit by the tsarist troops.
      In Ukraine, the first outbreaks of armed uprising began during the general October strike. The largest uprising in December 1905 occurred in the **Donbass**: in **Gorlovka** and **Lugansk**. Factory workers and miners fought with the tsarist troops for several days. The workers in Lugansk were then led by mechanic **Klim Voroshilov**.
      In Finland, workers created their own armed **Red Guard**. The Red Guard disarmed the tsarist police. Gendarmes, police officers, and tsarist officials left their service in **Finland** and fled to Russia.
      The Finnish people elected their government. The Finnish bourgeoisie, frightened by the strengthening of the revolutionary movement of workers, came to an agreement with the tsar and betrayed the workers. The labor movement was soon brutally suppressed. The Red Guard was destroyed and the government was dispersed.
      Oppressed peoples fought everywhere against the hated tsarist government. But the bourgeoisie of these peoples, like the Russians, fought the revolution in alliance with the tsarist government.
      The workers and peasants had to retreat this time. The Tsar, the landowners and the bourgeoisie turned out to be stronger than them. The blood of workers and peasants of all the peoples of Russia shed in the revolution brought the working people closer together and united them in a close great alliance for a new struggle.
      The revolution of 1905 found a response throughout the world. It was the most powerful struggle of the proletariat since the Paris Commune of 1871.
      Under the influence of the Russian Revolution, a massive strike movement began in Western Europe. In Turkey, the working people overthrew their **sultan**, in Iran — the **Shah**, in China — the **emperor**. A **republic** was established in China.
     
49. Defeat of the revolution
     
      Suppression of revolutionary uprisings. Despite the bloody reprisal against the rebel people, the revolution continued. In 1906, strikes by workers and protests by peasants, soldiers and sailors continued. Particularly significant were the sailors' uprisings in July — August 1906 in **Kronstadt** and **Sveaborg**. Thousands of sailors rebelled, killed officers, and established their power in individual fortress fortifications. But the sailors were poorly organized, and the tsarist officers managed to suppress the uprising. The government arrested more than 4 thousand sailors.
      Tsarist **Minister Stolypin** issued a law on the merciless destruction of revolutionaries. From 1906 to 1909, more than 2 thousand people were hanged under this law, sent to hard labor, exile and imprisoned 25 thousand people. Tens of thousands of revolutionaries were shot and tortured without trial. The arrested revolutionaries were mocked in every possible way: they were tortured in dungeons, needles were driven under their nails, burned with a hot iron, and starved. Stolypin attacked the Bolsheviks especially hard. Thousands of revolutionaries devoted to work died on the gallows and in hard labor.
      Many Bolshevik party organizations were defeated, the Soviets of Workers' Deputies were destroyed, trade unions and all peasant organizations were closed.
     
      Parties of exiles were driven one after another to Siberia.
     
      State Duma. In the same types of suppression of the revolutionary movement, Nicholas II convened the State Duma in 1906. According to the law on elections to the Duma, landowners and capitalists had the right to send more deputies there than tens of millions of workers and peasants. Women were disenfranchised. This was the royal constitution.
      But the tsar soon violated this constitution. The first and second State Dumas collected by the tsar were dispersed by him, since they were not always obedient to the tsar and his ministers. The tsar especially did not like the second thought. Many representatives of peasants and workers were elected to it. There were 65 Social Democrats in it. Workers and peasants in their speeches in the Duma exposed the tsarist government, all its tricks and the deception of the people. The Tsar ordered the Duma to be dispersed.
      Tsarist officials drew up a new law on elections to the Duma. The rights of workers and peasants were further reduced. All peoples of Siberia and Central Asia were deprived of voting rights to the Duma, and the rights of the peoples of the Caucasus and Poland were curtailed. And when the third Duma met in the fall of 1907, in the **Tauride Palace** in St. Petersburg, where Duma meetings took place, deputy seats were almost entirely filled with landowners, merchants, manufacturers, generals and royal dignitaries in gilded uniforms.
      Only in a few places sat deputies from workers, peasants and oppressed peoples of Russia.
      The State Duma has not changed the old order. As before, the nobles led by the Tsar ruled Russia and plundered it.
      The Third Duma approved the law of Tsarist Minister Stolypin on land. All the lands of the landowners remained with them. The peasants had to be content with the land they owned before, but only on new terms. Previously, most peasants owned land together and from time to time divided these communal lands among themselves according to the number of workers in their families. The Stolypin law destroyed community ownership of land. Each peasant was asked to take his plot of land into his personal possession, separate himself from the community and become the owner of his plot. Such peasants who separated from the community were called farmers, or bran.
      Poor peasants, who did not have working livestock, equipment, or money to pay taxes, sold their plots to rich peasants. The tsarist government sought this. It wanted to create small landowners from fists who would defend royal power.
      More than a million peasant poor completely lost their land and went bankrupt. The government resettled dissatisfied peasants to the lands of peoples living on the outskirts of Russia. The local population was driven by force from their native lands into deserts and mountains.
      Economy of the country after the revolution. Foreign capitalists also helped the tsarist government suppress the revolution. Even before the revolution, they bought plots of land in Russia with ore, oil, coal and built their own factories and factories. French and English bankers lent the tsarist government a lot of money, which was used to build railways, for the army, and for the maintenance of tsarist officials. The revolution in Russia threatened foreign capitalists with the loss of their capital and the enormous income they received in Russia.
     
      Metallurgical plant.
     
      Even before the revolution in Russia, capitalists began to unite in alliances to raise prices for goods and quickly deal with workers. Such associations of capitalists were called trusts and syndicates. After the revolution, there were more and more bourgeois trusts and syndicates.
      After several years of stagnation, industry in Russia revived again in 1910: the production of coal, metal, oil increased, and the production of sugar and fabrics increased. The export of bread abroad has increased significantly.
      Russia at this time took a step forward in its economy, but it continued to be a backward country compared to Western Europe and dependent on foreign capitalists. The production of machines and machine tools was not supplied to Russia — they were imported from abroad, there was no chemical industry. Russia did not know the production of mineral fertilizers. In arms production, Russia also lagged behind other capitalist countries.
      It turns out that there were more than enough reasons for the defeat of the first bourgeois revolution in Russia. The main one is the lack of a union of workers and peasants. If the peasants felt that a successful fight against the landowners was impossible without an alliance with the workers, then they did not at all understand that without the overthrow of tsarism it was impossible to defeat the landowners. The peasants still believed in the good will «of the Tsar-Father». That is why many peasants did not want to enter into an alliance with the workers to overthrow tsarism, and the sons of the peasants, dressed in soldiers' greatcoats, helped the tsar suppress strikes and worker uprisings. The peasants believed the Socialist Revolutionary compromisers more than the Bolshevik revolutionaries.
      The workers also had shortcomings. The working class was, of course, the vanguard of the revolution, but it was not yet united and united, since its party, Social Democracy, was divided into two groups: the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. The former were compromisers and did not want to bring the revolution to an end. The latter, that is, the Bolsheviks, were consistent Leninist revolutionaries and called on the workers to overthrow tsarism. That is why the workers did not always act together in the revolution and the working class did not have the opportunity to become the real leader (hegemon) of the revolution.
      The hastily concluded peace with Japan also helped the Tsar suppress the revolution. While the war was going on and the tsarist troops were being defeated, the tsar remained weak and had to yield to the onslaught of the workers. After the conclusion of peace, things changed, and the tsar had the opportunity to gather forces to fight the revolution.
     
50. A new revolutionary upsurge
     
      Lenin's departure abroad. Stalin at underground work in Russia. Despite numerous arrests and executions, the Bolsheviks continued the revolutionary struggle. They printed leaflets, newspapers, brochures. The Bolsheviks used elected meetings to the State Duma and meetings of the Duma itself to openly declare at them their revolutionary demands, the hatred of the masses towards the existing system.
      The entire tsarist police were put on their feet to catch the elusive Lenin. At the insistence of the party, Vladimir Ilyich went first to Finland and then abroad, to Switzerland. From there he continued to lead the workers' struggle.
      Lenin's comrade-in-arms and assistant — Comrade Stalin remained in Russia. His ebullient energy inspired the Bolsheviks to fight hard and hard. In 1908, Stalin was arrested again and exiled to one of the Siberian provinces. But Stalin's iron will could not be broken by prisons and exile, and the following year Stalin fled Siberia and returned to **Baku**. A year has passed. Stalin was arrested again and sent into exile again. He ran again. Soon he was tracked down again by tsarist spies, and the government expelled Stalin to the deserted **Narym region**. But the staunch revolutionary did not give up. In the summer of 1912, he secretly returned to St. Petersburg.
      Lenin abroad, and Stalin underground in Russia, continued the great work of the struggle for socialism, ready to give their blood drop by drop for the work cause.
      The Bolshevik heroes helped the working class survive the difficult time of the defeat of the revolution and rise again to the revolutionary struggle.
      Lena execution of workers. In the distant Siberian taiga, on the **Lena River**, there were gold mines of English capitalists. The life of the workers in these mines was not much different from the life of the convicts. The English capitalists received a profit of 7 million rubles in gold per year from these mines.
      In the spring of 1912, the workers of the Lena mines went on strike.
      At the request of the British, the tsarist government sent a detachment of troops to the mines under the command of a gendarmerie officer. He immediately arrested all the leaders of the workers and among them the exiled Bolsheviks. The workers demanded the release of those arrested. They went to the office. The workers walked a narrow path of several people in a row. Suddenly the bugler's horn began to play. At the command of the gendarme officer, the soldiers lined the road. The command was — to shoot.
     
      Execution of workers at the Lena mines on April 4, 1912.
     
      Shots rang out. And more and more soldiers shot at the workers. In the snow, 250 dead and 270 wounded workers lay in pools of blood.
      The news of the execution on the Lena River spread throughout Russia. Hundreds of thousands of workers quit their jobs and took to the streets to protest the new massacre.
      On May 1, 1912, half a million workers went on strike in Russia. In the villages, peasants again took up axes, scythes and pitchforks and destroyed landowners' estates. Over 13 thousand revolutionary peasant uprisings took place in 1910–1914.
      The Russian people rose to a new struggle and walked towards a new revolution.
      Bolsheviks — independent Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. In 1912, representatives of Russian Bolshevik committees gathered abroad, in the city of **Prague**, for a conference. The conference decided to expel all Mensheviks and all unstable and wavering from the party.
      A unified militant Leninist Bolshevik Party was created. She led the working class and peasantry to a new resolution for the overthrow of tsarist power and the establishment of the power of workers and peasants, for the establishment of an 8-hour working day and for the free transfer of all lands for the use of peasants.
      The Bolsheviks strengthened their secret party organizations in Russia, trade unions, workers' clubs and other open workers' organizations that were under the leadership of the Bolsheviks.
      Bolshevik newspapers began to be published in St. Petersburg «**Zvezda**», and then «**Pravda**». Bolshevik «Truth» was written in a simple and understandable language for all workers. She helped workers learn the teachings of the Bolshevik Party. The police continuously pursued this newspaper, prohibited its sale, and imprisoned editors. IN. AND. Lenin wrote articles in «Pravda» and directed it from abroad. I worked in «Pravda». IN. Stalin, **V. M. Molotov** and others.
     
      Barricades in St. Petersburg in July 1914.
     
      At this time, the party raised many strong and brave Bolshevik revolutionaries. Among them was **Ya. M. Sverdlov**. He began the revolutionary struggle from the age of seventeen. He spent many years in prison, was in exile, from where he escaped several times, finally reached St. Petersburg and fearlessly led the fight against tsarism. **S. M. Kirov** began its revolutionary activities back in 1905 and did not stop it for a minute. Only prisons and exiles were temporarily separated from the work of this ardent revolutionary. **M. IN. Frunze**, **G. K. Ordzhonikidze**, **V. IN. Kuibyshev**, **F. E. Dzerzhinsky** — they were all brave fighters of the party for the work cause. M. worked in the party, sparing no effort. **AND. Kalinin**, **K. E. Voroshilov**, **L. M. Kaganovich**, **N. K. Krupskaya** and many others. It was the iron guard of the party, tireless and persistent students and comrades of Lenin and Stalin.
      Lenin moved from Paris, where he lived, to Austria, closer to the Russian border, to better direct the work of the Bolsheviks in Russia.
      At this time, strikes broke out in Russia one after another. In Baku, where Stalin created a strong Bolshevik organization, workers declared a general strike in the oil fields. The workers fought for about a month, but the force was on the side of the manufacturers.
      In the summer of 1914, workers in St. Petersburg again stopped factories and factories. They went out into the street with red banners. The workers responded to the attack by troops and police with resistance on the barricades.
      But the rise of the revolution was delayed by the world war that broke out at the same time. In this war, the tsarist government again sought salvation or revolution.
     
XI. Second bourgeois revolution in Russia
     
51. World imperialist war
     
      Tsarist Russia in war. In the summer of 1914, the world war began. This war has been in preparation for a long time. Large capitalist states competed with each other. By the beginning of the 20th century, there was not a piece of land on the globe that had not been captured by any state. Capitalists from different countries sought to take away rich lands with large populations from each other. German capitalists and landowners were especially eager to seize. Germany sought to seize some of its African colonies from England, from Russia — Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic states; Russia sought to seize **Constantinople** from Turkey; England — **Mesopotamia** and **Palestine**; France sought to regain **Alsace-Lorraine**, occupied by Germany. In preparation for this predatory war, the capitalists were divided into two camps. In one camp there were — England, France and Russia, dependent on them.Their alliance was called the **Entente**. In **another camp** — Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria. The Entente was supported by almost all European states. Japan and the United States of America were in alliance with them.
      The bourgeoisie of the warring countries prepared this predatory war in secret from the people. First, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, then Germany, which had long been preparing for war, declared war on Russia. After this, other countries entered the war. When the war began, the bourgeoisie of all warring countries deceived the people, declaring this war a war to save their homeland from the enemy. Petty-bourgeois compromising parties — Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries helped deceive the people of the Russian bourgeoisie.
      The world war lasted 4 years and cost humanity about 30 million lives. Most of the losses were in the army of Tsarist Russia.
      While the Germans bombarded the Russian army with shells, the tsarist ministers and generals left it without sufficient weapons and shells.
      Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers died every day from German cannon fire, machine guns and disease. But the tsarist generals, obedient to the orders of Tsar Nicholas II and the Entente, drove the soldiers on more and more offensives. The generals did not take into account losses; for them, the soldiers were only cannon fodder. In the very first months, in the fields of Germany, mediocre tsarist generals destroyed an entire army of 200 thousand people. In Russia, more and more new soldiers were being recruited. At first they took only young people as soldiers, and then they moved on to older ages. In total, up to 19 million people were taken to war in Russia.
      During the war, the Russian army inflicted several brutal defeats on the Austro-German army. The Russian offensive on the Southwestern Front in the summer of 1916 was especially successful.
      Huge trophies and over 100 thousand prisoners were captured by the Russian army. This victory forced the Germans to transfer a large number of troops from the Western Front to the Eastern Russian Front and thereby helped **Italy**, France and England stop the German advance on the Western Front.
      However, the remarkable breakthrough of the Southwestern Front was not supported by other Russian armies. The incompetent main command and the tsarist government were unable to either arm or supply the army with everything it needed. At the royal court, in the ministries, in the army, I had German spies who passed on military secrets to the Germans. Bleeding, dying from gas attacks, freezing in the trenches, the tsarist army, led by incompetent generals, was forced to retreat. By 1916, the Germans had captured Poland, Lithuania, and part of Latvia. But there was no end in sight to the war.
      The war greatly destroyed the Russian economy. There was not enough metal, coal, oil. Factories were shut down. The railways did not even have time to transport troops. The army and people were stripped and stripped. The population and soldiers at the front were starving. The grain crops were reduced — there was no one to cultivate the land. A mass of horses and cattle were taken from the peasants for the army. The protracted war fell with incredible weight on the shoulders of workers and peasants.
      Bolsheviks during the war. The Bolshevik Party opposed the world massacre. Lenin and the party called on workers and peasants to turn their weapons against their oppressors and exposed the meanness of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries and their masters — capitalists.
      In the very first days of the war, workers' organizations were defeated and closed. The Bolshevik newspaper «Pravda» was banned on the eve of the declaration of war. The Bolsheviks — deputies of the Fourth State Duma — were sent to Siberia to settle for calling for a fight against the war, for calling the workers to revolution.
      The work of the Bolsheviks during the war was difficult. Lenin was separated from Russia by borders and fronts. Other leaders of the Bolshevik Party were in exile. Many Bolsheviks were in prison.
      But the work of the Bolsheviks did not stop.
      Revolutionary movement during the war. Mass strikes began in Russia under the leadership of the Bolsheviks.
      In 1915, there were already 928 strikes in Russia, and in January and February 1917 — 1330 strikes. The workers continued to fight under the slogan: «Down with the war! Down with the tsarist autocracy!»
      The workers of **Petrograd** (as St. Petersburg was called from 1914 to 1924) fought in the forefront. In October 1916, they organized a huge political strike against the war and the tsarist autocracy. They even attracted a regiment of soldiers to their side.
      The workers were also supported by the peasants; they climbed through the villages to fight against the war, landowners and Stolypin’s laws on land.

      All the most advanced peasants were in the army. Discontent grew there, and soon, under the influence of the Bolsheviks sent by the party to the army to work, protests against the war began among soldiers.
      The Tsarist soldiers at the front began to fraternize with German and Austrian soldiers. The same fraternization took place on other fronts of the warring states. The soldiers demanded an end to the bloodbath.
      During the war, oppressed peoples also began to rise up in the revolutionary struggle against the tsarist government. Heavy extortions, cattle rustling and violence against workers caused enormous discontent. Dissatisfaction intensified when they began to hire people for rear work.
      In 1916, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tajiks and Turkmens rebelled. They attacked cities, entered into battle with the tsarist troops and police, and killed their volost elders — servants of the tsarist authorities.
      The Kazakhs created their own armed combat units. The leader of the uprising was the brave hero of the Kazakh people — **Amangeldy Imanov**.
      The rebel Uzbeks destroyed railway tracks to prevent the delivery of troops, burned stations and cut telegraph wires.
      In Kyrgyzstan, the rebels obtained weapons by taking away military vehicles. In the mountains they built forges and workshops for making gunpowder.
      The tsarist authorities sent troops with cannons, machine guns, and armored cars against the rebels. In the blood and smoke of burned villages and villages, they strangled these uprisings.
      But the united struggle of workers, peasants, soldiers and oppressed peoples against the war, against the tsarist government, was steadily growing.
